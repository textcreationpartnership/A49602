            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALthough I have undertaken this Work for the Edification of all our Churches; nevertheleſs I offer it to you in particular, as a teſtimony of my due reſentments for the Honour you formerly did me in inviting me to you. I ſhould willingly have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced your offer, if my Conſcience could have diſpenced with it; for beſides that the Employment had been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and profitable to me, it would have drawn me alſo a little nearer to my own Country, for which I ſtill retain an Inclination. But the Providence of God; which orders our Perſons and Affairs as he pleaſes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving otherways diſpos'd of my Miniſtry, beſtowing it on a Church where I found a ſecond Native Countrey, by the marks of kindneſs I daily receiv'd of the goodneſs of thoſe whereof it is compos'd; I loſe by little and little the hopes of ever ſeeing my Native Countrey, and by conſequence, of aſſuring you by word of mouth, the true ſentiments of my heart. But Gentlemen, if I am at a diſtance from you in Body, I deſire you to be aſſured, that I am preſent with you in Spirit, ſeeing you
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:63628:4"/>are always in my remembrance, and that I ſhall ever ardently beſeech God, that he will generally and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular beſtow on you his bleſſings. Moreover, the Work which I preſent to you, will doubtleſs adminiſter to you joy and comfort, in manifeſting the Antiquity of the Diſcipline under whoſe Maxims you live; for as it ſcatters the falſe Aſperſions of Novelty wherewith we are branded, and the unjuſt reproaches wherewith you are dayly accus'd; you will therein find ſuch lively Marks and Characters of the Diſcipline of the Ancient Chriſtians, that you will bleſs God for ſeeing that your Fathers have walked ſo Religiouſly in that, as well as in the Doctrine which their Anceſtors had profeſſed, that is to ſay, of thoſe which had lived in the pureſt and happieſt Ages of Chriſtianity. And indeed, if you pleaſe to give your ſelves the trouble to compare together theſe two Diſciplines, you will ſoon find they are Children of one Father, productions of the ſame Spirit; and that drawing their Original from Heaven, it is alſo their ſcope to direct men to Heaven, in building them up in Sanctification and Holineſs. After which, let men, if they pleaſe, blame your Eccleſiaſtical Policy; hence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you will have ſufficient ground to ſtop the mouth of Envy, and wherewithal to confound thoſe which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cenſure it. To juſtifie it, 'twill be enough to ſhew the Conformity there is betwixt it and that of the Primitive Church; and this you may eaſily do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:63628:4"/>I think I have ſo fully evinced this reſemblance, that it will be viſible to all thoſe who will read this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe with an unbiaſs'd mind, and that are not prepoſſeſs'd with malice againſt us. As for us, Gentlemen, let us faithfully keep the holy truſt our Fathers have tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us; let us diligently exerciſe this Diſcipline, and carefully practiſe it; but eſpecially let us to our power conform to the Exerciſe of theſe Precepts by the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Lives, and the purity of our Actions; this will be the ready way of baffling the many Volumes that attack your Morals; and ſhew to all the World, that theſe Inſtructions have no other ſcope but Juſtice and Piety. Actions are of greater demonſtration than Words; and the Arguments drawn from Practice, are more convincing than thoſe that are borrowed from Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. It was never better proved, That there was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Nature, than it was done by the Philoſopher, that walked about to convince him that deni'd it. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better juſtifie the purity of the Maxims of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Diſcipline, than in living well; ſeeing 'tis very difficult, if not impoſſible, to live well under Maſters which only teach Debauchery, and that ingage perſons in Extravagance. Thoſe who pleaſe to look on your Society, will be convinced of what I ſay, when they ſhall ſee in your wiſe conduct, to ſhine forth the marks and effects of the innocency of your Diſcipline, and the equity of its Maxims and Laws. I hope you will favourably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat Laws are in a State, the ſame things are Canons in the Church: All Societies of Men, as well Civil as Sacred, have always ſtood in need of ſome Rules for the conduct of thoſe whereof it is compoſed, and under their direction to attain the deſigned end, which is pleaſure of life, with the repoſe of Conſcience, and tranquility of Mind. Man ought of his own free will be inclined to the obedience of theſe, in the main proſpect of the pleaſure there is in doing his Duty, and in the delight which is to be found in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Vertue; beſides that in ſo doing, depends the happineſs all men ſeek after, but which few do find, becauſe they ſeek amiſs. Nevertheleſs, according to the manner we are made, it's neceſſary we ſhould be excited by other motives, and be ſet a work by other principles; theſe Motives are, Fear of puniſhment, and Hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; the two great ſprings that give motion, if it may be ſo ſaid, to the whole world, and which do powerfully ingage men to eſchew evil, and do good. Legiſlators have alſo employ'd it in the world; the Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors, in the Church; and God himſelf made uſe of it in regard of <hi>Adam,</hi> promiſing him Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, if he continued faithful and obedient to him; and on the contrary, threatning him with death, if he were ſo fooliſh as to neglect the keeping his Commands, and violate the purity of his Laws: <hi>In the day thou eateſt the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou ſhalt die the death.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="x" facs="tcp:63628:6"/>
            <p>Man being a reaſonable Creature, it was ſuitable to God's wiſdom to give him Laws to ſerve as a Rule and direction through the whole courſe of his life; therefore he had no ſooner created him, but he imprinted in his heart thoſe inſtructions which we call the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Exerciſe whereof was to conſtitute his joy and felicity; ſo that had he always perſever'd in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, he would not have ſtood in need of Judges, nor of their Tribunals; his conſcience would have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for him; its counſels would ever have been ſafe, its deciſions juſt and right, and all its Ordinances would have tended to the practiſe of this important maxim of the Son of God, which he drew from the very ſpring of Nature it ſelf, <hi>not to do to others, but what we would they ſhould do to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſin having interrupted this Oeconomy, and darkned the Lights which attended it, all theſe directions of Nature have been ineffectual, and theſe Inſtructions of no value. Nevertheleſs 'tis certain, God preſerved in Man after his fall, or at leaſt he ſtirred up in him anew, by the efficacy of his Providence, ſome little remains of that clear and pure light wherewith the underſtanding had been illuminated when 'twas immediately made by his hand; and thence it is that all men have the common and general Notions, That there is one God; That he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all things; That he puniſhes the wicked, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the good; That to honour him, is a Law that's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed amongſt all men; And that he muſt not only be thought to be immortal and bleſſed, but alſo to be a Lover of Mankind, of whoſe preſervation he takes particular care, in daily doing them good; it was thereby that the Inhabitants of the Iſle of <hi>Maltha</hi> concluded St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Murderer;

<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:63628:6"/>no longer.</hi> It is alſo from this principle proceeded the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Apoſtle attributed to the Gentiles, when he ſaith, <hi>For when the Gentiles which have not the Law,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14, 15.</note> do by nature the things contain'd in the law; theſe having not the law, are a law unto themſelves, which ſhew the work of the law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts in the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But at length Sin having almoſt extinguiſhed the light of Nature, and made all its inſtructions unprofitable, God was obliged to renew the knowledg of it, by publiſhing his Law, which in ſubſtance contains the ſame precepts as thoſe did which God had writ at firſt in the heart of Men; and ſeeing the greater corruption is, ſo much the more need there is to multiply Laws to reſtrain its impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity and violence, and ſo hinder its ſpreading and exceſs; God, who knew very well the inclination of the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were a people of a ſtiff neck, and uncircumciſed heart, as the Scripture ſpeaks; a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple inclined to diſobedience and rebellion; God, I ſay, not content to divulge the Moral Law, he thereunto joyned the Ceremonial and Political Laws, to the end the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould the eaſier be retain'd in their duty, under the heavy yoke of this ſevere Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Thence it followed by the Rule of contraries, That the more Sanctification is advanced, the leſs need there is of Laws; which made St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, That the Law is not made for the juſt, but for the Sinners and wicked. The firſt Chriſtians had but very few Deciſions and Decrees in their Diſcipline, becauſe being full of Piety and Zeal, and that labouring with unſpeakable diligence in the work of their Sanctification, they diſpoſed themſelves voluntarily according to the nature of the Goſpel, and intention of Jeſus Chriſt, and conſcionably practiſing
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:63628:7"/>the Maxim of the Apoſtle, <hi>That all things ſhould be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and in order, in the Church of God;</hi> they with eaſe were guided by the Divine motions of Grace, and the inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that holy Spirit which God had ſo plentifully, and in great meaſure poured forth on his Church in the firſt Eſtabliſhing of Chriſtian Religion; for as to the Canons attributed to the Apoſtles, and the Conſtitutions which alſo go in their name, they are things forged in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Ages; and after this new people had began to degenerate from the firſt heat of their zeal, and that they had given ſome check to the innocence of their life, and to the purity of their Manners; and as corruption inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly got ground; ſo alſo was ſeen to increaſe, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Canons and Ordinances; for it commonly happens, that ill actions do multiply good Laws, without which it would be impoſſible to make head againſt the many Scandals that licentiouſneſs does introduce where it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominates, and where ſins are not repreſſed and puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Something of this kind hapned in our Reformation, which had a great reſemblance with the firſt Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtian Religion; for it may truly be ſaid, that by a particular bleſſing of Heaven, the firſt Reformers were ſo holy in their life, ſo pure in their converſation, ſo wiſe in their conduct, ſo modeſt in their words, and ſo humble in their actions, that all their ſtudy and care ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only to Piety and Virtue, without being needful to incline them to it by any great number of Rules; ſo alſo their Diſcipline at firſt conſiſted in forty little Articles, which were compoſed by the firſt National Synod held at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the year 1559; whereas that we have at this time, contain'd in 14. Chapters, 222. Articles, much more large and ample than the firſt.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of this difference, proceeds from the change which in time hapned to thoſe that liv'd in our
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:63628:7"/>Communion, and that were Members of our Churches; had they always followed the ſteps of their Anceſtors, and that they had been faithful Repreſentatives of their Innocence, and of their purity, they would have ſtood in need but of very few Rules; becauſe the only love of Virtue, would have ſeaſoned all their actions, animated all their motions, mortified their paſſions and deſires, and lighted in their Souls a Divine flame, which would have raiſed their thoughts from Earth to Heaven, and the which in ſnatching them by a holy violence from the love of the Creatures, would inſeparably have faſtned them to the love of the Creator.</p>
            <p>But becauſe there is always ſome remains of Man in Man, and that the fleſh too often prevails over the ſpirit; they by little and little degenerated from the zeal of their Fathers, and their piety inſenſibly falling into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream coldneſs, they ſuffered themſelves to fall into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny defects, which diſhonoured the Holineſs of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and which obliged their Guides to increaſe from time to time, the number of Laws, to reſtrain by the authority of thoſe Ordinances the courſe of their diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to ſtop the ſpring of thoſe abuſes; wherein they wiſely followed the conduct of the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who ſeeing a great negligence in the lives of Chriſtians, added to their Conſtitutions new Decrees, proportionable as the Sins of Men gave them matter and occaſion; knowing well, that 'twas the only means to preſerve in its purity, a Religion which had been cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and conſecrated by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, How large ſoever our Diſcipline at this time may be, and how much ſoever is increaſed the number of its Canons, I dare boldly ſay, That never was a better Diſcipline; and that there was never ſeen an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:63628:8"/>Policy, more judiciouſly compoſed, than it is; if one take the pains to read it without prejudice, one ſhall agree to this truth, and unleſs one be extreamly prepoſſeſt with prejudice againſt it, it muſt be granted, that the Conſtitutions are juſt, that the Rules are holy, and that all the Decrees have no other aim but the glory of God, and the holineſs of thoſe which ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the keeping of his Laws; all the parts of this body anſwer one the other; they march an equal pace, and agree all to the ſame end; the form of Government which it preſcribes, is indeed very ſimple, but it is Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical; the order it will have one follow, is full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs; and if the Government it eſtabliſhes, is far from ſplendor and pomp, it is wholly bedew'd in juſtice and equity. In a word, All that's contain'd in it, was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a ſpirit of love and ſweetneſs.</p>
            <p>After all this, what is there can be blam'd in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline? Is it the Eſtabliſhment of its Miniſters? But there muſt be ſuch to inſtruct the people. Is it the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Eſtabliſhment? But it is conformable to that which was obſerved in the Primitive Church. Is it the qualities which is deſired to be in them? But they are the very ſame which St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires in thoſe which conſecrate themſelves to the holy Miniſtry, Is it the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whereunto they are obliged? But in this alſo is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the precepts of the ſame Apoſtle, ſeeing they are obliged to preach the Word of God, to adminiſter the Sacraments which he has inſtituted, to live unblameably, to be an Example to their Flock in word and actions, to edifie them by their Sermons, and by their Example, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of great Cenſures to thoſe which do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves as they ought of theſe juſt Duties, even to the ſuſpending and depoſing thoſe which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Scandalous offences, and ſuch as deſerve ſuſpenſion and depoſition.</p>
            <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:63628:8"/>
            <p>Shall our Schools be condemn'd? But the uſe of them is too ancient, and too neceſſary; for 'tis convenient to inſtruct youth, and teach them with care, that they may one day be fit inſtruments in the hand of God for the propagating his truth, and for eſtabliſhing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Son.</p>
            <p>If any carp at our Conſiſtories; it ſhall be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that from the beginning there was in every Church an Eccleſiaſtical Senate, which informed themſelves of all which concerned the good and edification of the Flock.</p>
            <p>If any quarrel at our Lay Church Elders, we will make appear, that their Inſtitution is almoſt as ancient as the ſetling of Chriſtianity; and that the Primitive Church having uſed it ſucceſsfully ſeveral Ages, we alſo make uſe of it with much utility, according to its example.</p>
            <p>As for Deacons, all the world knows they were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the Apoſtles, and amongſt us they anſwer very well to the deſign of their Inſtitution; for they take care of the Poor, and diſtribute to them the gifts and charity of good people, as their true Patrimony.</p>
            <p>As to the Union of the Churches, St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares ſufficiently of what importance it is, when he exhorts us to <hi>keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, and to be one body and one ſpirit, as being called to the hope of one and the ſame vocation.</hi> The ancient Doctors have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended nothing with more care than this holy union; nor cenſur'd any thing with more ardor and zeal, than the Diviſions and Schiſms which divide the Church, and tear to pieces the ſeamleſs Coat of our Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Our Colloquies are nothing elſe in effect, but Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Miniſters and Elders of ſome certain Aſſociation, or part of a Country, deputed by their Churches to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate all together of Affairs which offer, and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:63628:9"/>the quiet and comfort of thoſe which ſent them; ſo that they cannot be condemned without cenſuring at the ſame time, the Synods which are called Dioceſan, to which they have no little reſemblance.</p>
            <p>Who can find any fault with our Provincial and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Synods, ſeeing they are grounded on the practice of the Primitive Church, and on the authority of the Canons which ſo frequently recommend the holding and calling of them.</p>
            <p>One muſt be very ill humoured to blame what we do in our Aſſemblies, all the holy Exerciſes whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in Invocating the Name of God, in Singing of Pſalms, in Preaching his Word, and in the adminiſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sacraments being the Seals of his Covenant, and Symbols of our Redemption, they cannot be Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with too great reſpect, nor too much reverence cannot be ſhewn when they are adminiſter'd; and 'tis this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reverence which has been endeavoured to be inſpir'd in Believers amongſt us, by the directions which has been made about the adminiſtration of Baptiſm, and the Celebration of the Lord's Supper.</p>
            <p>There has no leſs care been had in preſerving the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Matrimony, from whence has been removed all manner of filthineſs and impurity, and all imaginable precaution uſed to render it legitimate.</p>
            <p>To conclude, As for the Advertiſements which regard particular perſons, it has been made known to all the world, that nothing elſe was intended but to diſpoſe Chriſtians to Piety and Holineſs, and generally to all Virtues, which are worthy the name they bear, and of the Religion they profeſs.</p>
            <p>Behold here the ſubſtance of our Diſcipline, which how innocent ſoever it be, nevertheleſs has found adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:63628:9"/>who being animated with a ſpirit contrary to that of Chriſtianity, have traduc'd it, and ſtill daily rail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, declaiming againſt it in their Pulpits, endeavour to render it odious, by the calumnies they accuſe it of, and by the unjuſt reproaches they load it with; as if thoſe which compoſed it, and which have reduced it to the form wherein we find it, had no other deſign but to open the door to Licentiouſneſs, to foment Vice, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Debauchery and Exceſs; but let them ſay what they liſt, God which bringeth to light the ſecrets of all hearts, will be the Judge of our Innocence, and will one day cover with confuſion and ſhame, thoſe which ſo cruelly cenſure and injure us.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, I truſt, with the bleſſing of his Grace, that the reading of this Treatiſe will better inform them, and that finding therein an intire Conformity betwixt our Diſcipline, and that of the Primitive Chriſtians, they ſhall be forc'd to change their notes, leſt that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the one, they alſo condemn the other; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble one another too much, not to approve, and like of both. 'Tis true, that the better to diſcern this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, Conſcience muſt be conſulted, ſilence muſt be impoſed on the Paſſions, and all prejudice, which blinds our ſight, and darkens our judgment, muſt be laid aſide; by this means the Conformity here propoſed will be eaſily diſcerned; and having diſcovered it, they will declare for us; for there would be no reaſon to make that paſs for blaſphemy in our mouths which was eſteemed Oracles in the mouth of the ancient Fathers, neither to reject this rule of our conduct, ſeeing it is the ſame that theirs was.</p>
            <p>It is what I undertake to prove in this Book; and to make the thing the more evident, I have examined from firſt to laſt, all the Articles one after another, that none
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:63628:10"/>might think I had a deſign to caſt a miſt over the Eyes of the Readers, in eſtabliſhing a Conformity in too large and general a way; and that to ſave the credit of our Diſcipline, I would not deſcend to a particular ſearch and examination. In effect, the firſt thing I do is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Text of each Article, then I cite the Decrees of Councils and Teſtimonies of Fathers, as much as may be neceſſary to juſtifie the reſemblance which is in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; from this Article I paſs to another, and ſo go on unto the laſt; and I can ſay with a ſafe Conſcience, that in this work I have not uſed fraud nor artifice, that there will be ſeen throughout the whole Book a great deal or plainneſs, and if in ſome parts more of art and skill be required, I am perſwaded that there never will be cauſe to deſire more of fidelity; becauſe I had ſo particular a view of reſembling theſe two Diſciplines, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo plainly the features and lineaments, that the one might eaſily be taken for the other, as it often happens to two Twins, and to find in ours a true Copy of the Prototype, and of the true Original.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I warn the Reader, that having done as I have now mention'd, nevertheleſs I have diſpenſed my ſelf in reciting at large all that I alledg of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, fearing to deform the Edition; becauſe the whole Work is but a continued tiſſue of Canons and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; therefore I have only done it when I thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and in thoſe places which abſolutely requir'd it. Secondly, The Reader may take notice, I do not always write the whole Decrees, but juſt what relates to the matter I examine, reſerving the reſt for clearing ſome other Article, if it be proper for it. And to conclude, In the things which are evident, and approv'd of all, I have not oblig'd my ſelf exactly, in all places, to cite the proper terms of Authors, but juſt the ſenſe and ſubſtance;
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:63628:10"/>which nevertheleſs, I have done in ſuch a way, that none will have cauſe to blame my Conduct, if they will pleaſe to compare with the Originals, what I have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
            <p>Although what I have hitherto writ be more than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſtop the mouth of Calumny, and to juſtifie our Eccleſiaſtical Government; nevertheleſs there are ſome ſuch untoward and croſs ſpirits, and withal ſo full of prejudice againſt us, that they make paſs for Criminal, the things which are moſt innocent; and eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn what is well worthy the Eſteem and Love of the beſt of Men: For inſtance, If we forbid Dancing, Comedies, the Play of Hazard, Mummeries, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Shrovetide</hi> Carnivals, and other Follies of this kind, They ſay we are Leaders of the blind; and they injuriouſly compare us to thoſe Hypocrites in the Goſpel, to whom our Saviour ſays, <hi>They ſtrain at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Camel;</hi> never conſidering that in acting after this manner, they leſſen the Glory of the Fathers, which have ſo highly reproved the ſame things, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſevere Cenſures againſt all thoſe which allowed themſelves in theſe worldly pleaſures; were they not blinded with prejudice, they would ſpeak after another manner, and they would infer from the ſeverity of theſe Laws, That thoſe which made them, were guided by the Spirit of God, which inſpir'd them with ſo great a Love to Virtue, and ſo great a Hatred to Vice, That they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid thoſe which lived under their Authority and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, the uſe of thoſe things which were capable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the purity of their Lives, and to ſtop the courſe of their Piety and Sanctification.</p>
            <p>But the Cenſurers of our Diſcipline ſtop not there; they pretend, it favours <hi>Libertiniſme,</hi> becauſe it permits thoſe which ſeparate for the cauſe of Adultery, to Marry
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:63628:11"/>ſome other perſon; and it may be ſaid, That this ſole Article opens to the Preachers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, a wide Field to declaim againſt us; and that they take occaſion, or rather a pretext, to accuſe us, as if we were favourers of Vice, and enemies of Virtue: There are alſo amongſt them perſons conſiderable for the Rank they bear, which treat us with no leſs injuſtice, for that having but little or no knowledg of the Ancient Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Chriſtians, they imagine it was no way diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that which they at this time follow; and on this wrong ground, they look on them as <hi>Libertines,</hi> which teach that the band of Marriage may be broke by reaſon of Adultery; nevertheleſs 'tis the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, who formally declares in the Goſpel, That 'tis only for Adultery that Marriage may be diſſolv'd, as well to the Bed, as the Obligation. I know, St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and ſome others, have found difficulty in the explication of the Words of our Saviour, and that they could not fully reſolve to explain them in the manner I juſt now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; at leaſt St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſes in ſeveral places of his Writings, That the Queſtion concerning the Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Marriages for cauſe of Adultery, is very obſcure and difficult, and is, what made him write on this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, which would ſeem contradictory, if one did not diſtinguiſh the times wherein he applied himſelf to write on this queſtion.</p>
            <p>For it is moſt certain, in what he wrote before the 2d Council of <hi>Mileva,</hi> which was held in the year of our Lord 416. he appear'd unreſolv'd and undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, finding great difficulties, obſtructions almoſt impaſſible, and depths not eaſily to be fathomed; thoſe that will pleaſe to take the pains to ſee what he writes in the 3d Chapter of his Book againſt <hi>Adimentius,</hi> in the 7th of the Book touching the Comfort of Marriage, in the
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:63628:11"/>8th and 25th Chapters of the 1ſt Book of Adulterous Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, that is to ſay, of Marriages diſhonoured by Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and joyn to theſe Teſtimonies which are in the 6th <hi>Tome,</hi> thoſe others which are in the 4th, to wit, The 19th Chapter of the Book of Faith and Works, the laſt Queſtion of the Book of 83 Queſtions, and the 16th Chapter of the firſt Book of the Sermon of our Lord on the Mount; thoſe I ſay, which will take the pains to read all theſe places which I have inſtanc'd, will agree to the irreſolution and trouble St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was in, on the ſubject now ſpoke of, and eſpecially if they conſider the ſincere Confeſſion which he makes in one of the places I have cited; <hi>Having,</hi> ſaith he,
<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Adult. Conjug. cap 25. Tom. 6.</note> 
               <hi>thus Treated and Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd theſe things according to my capacity, I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that the Queſtion touching Marriages, is very obſcure and difficult, and I do not dare to ſay that I have yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in this Work, nor that I am able, if you preſs me, to reſolve hereafter, in any other, all the difficulties which accompany it.</hi> He confeſſes the ſame thing,
<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Retract. cap. 57. Tom. 1.</note> although in terms a little different, in recalling the Books wherein is found the Teſtimony which juſtifies what I have alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his doubtfulneſs, and declares with his uſual hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, That he don't think to have given to this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all the clearneſs it requires.</p>
            <p>After this Council of <hi>Mileva,</hi> this Holy Doctor wrote ſeveral Treatiſes, wherein he explains himſelf more fully than he had done in the others; for inſtance, In the 19th Chapter of the firſt Book of Retractaions, he ſaith, <hi>That 'tis out of doubt, that one may leave his Wife for the Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which is committed in Adultery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his 89th Letter to <hi>Hillarius,</hi> Queſt. 4. He confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>That by the Laws of Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Tom. 2.</note> it is not permitted to leave one's Wife but for the cauſe of Adultery, and that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt forbid to put her away for any other Cauſe but
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:63628:12"/>for Adultery;</hi> And in the 9th Treatiſe upon St. <hi>John, It is permitted to put away the Wife for the cauſe of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
<note place="margin">Tom. 9.</note> becauſe ſhe has firſt refuſed to be a Wife, in not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her vow of Wedlock to her Husband.</hi> To judge of the mind of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> by theſe latter Teſtimonies, which are more formal and poſitive than the former; it may be concluded, That he believed having well examin'd the matter, that the band of Marriage was broke by Adultery: Nevertheleſs, becauſe that in the other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings he could not ſatisfy himſelf, nor clear all their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties wherewith this queſtion ſeem'd to be always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred, I would not make uſe of His Authority, for Eſtabliſhing the Conformity of our Diſcipline with that of the Primitive Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>This Council of <hi>Mileva</hi> above-mention'd, forbids in the 17th of its Canons, which is the 102. in the <hi>African</hi> Code, it forbids him that is repudiated by his Wife, and to the Woman put off by the Husband, to re-marry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any one elſe, and enjoyns them to live ſingle, or to be reconcil'd again, threatning to put them into the number of Penitents if they diſobey this Decree, which the Fathers of the Synod pretend to be conformable to the Evangelical and Apoſtolical Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; But in the firſt place, they do not declare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſpeak of a ſeparation occaſion'd by Adultery, or by ſome other cauſe, for the which Jeſus Chriſt don't permit of Separation. Secondly, The Conduct of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> who aſſiſted at this Council, makes me ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that either the Fathers of <hi>Mileva</hi> ſpake of Divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beſides for the Cauſe of Adultery, or at leaſt if they regarded Divorces grounded upon Adultery, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did not forbear Writing after the Convocation of this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, That 'tis permitted to put away the Wife for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Adultery. Thirdly, When the Council it ſelf with
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:63628:12"/>ſome other Doctors ſhould more fully explain themſelves, and that they ſhould have formally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd the ſecond Marriage of thoſe which had been put away for Adultery, it would not from thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that I have not made appear that our Diſcipline does not ſuffer in this occaſion, only what the Ancient Chriſtian Diſcipline of the Church ſuffered, ſeeing I have proved it by the Canons of divers Councils, by the Decrees of ſome Popes in their Synods, and by the practice of all the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, a practice which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> dared not to condemn, after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances made by the Ambaſſador of <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet farther, It is what a famous Doctor of the Communion of <hi>Rome</hi> has fully juſtified, without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us, nor the innocency of our Conduct on the point in Controverſy, in a Book which he publiſhed two or three years ago, touching the power of Kings and Sovereigns over Marriages; for in the 3d Part, Art. 1. Chap. 5. he hath at large repreſented to the Reader, the Tradition of the Church on the matter of Marriages occaſion'd by Adultery, whereas I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented my ſelf to relate in my Work, what is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive in the Tradition, and leaſt of all ſubject to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy and Conteſtation. Whatever's the matter, after ſo many explanations, there is hope to believe, That Men will not for the future cry ſo much againſt this Article of our Diſcipline, which has given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to our Enemies to accuſe us of favouring Vice and Libertiniſme.</p>
            <p>I could, if it were needful, mention other Cavils of ſome leſſer Diſputers againſt the Holineſs of our Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Laws, which they have ſpoke very injuriouſly of, as if they were directly contrary to the Rules of the firſt Chriſtians, and as if thoſe which made them, had
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:63628:13"/>taken pleaſure quite to forſake its uſe and practiſe; but 'tis much better to refer to the reader the liberty of judging of our innocence when he ſhall have Read the whole Treatiſe; for beſides that I cannot refute theſe injuries and ſlanders, without diſcovering perſons who have lately been forward this way, unleſs I would write a Volume, and not a Preface, would I undertake to anſwer particularly to all the falſe accuſations which they have alledged to render our Religion odious, in cenſuring our Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Laying therefore apart theſe unjuſt Accuſers, 'tis needful, before ending this Preface, that I ſpeak a little of ſome others whoſe Learning and Reputation is better known and grounded, and yet nevertheleſs, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a falſe Zeal, or by ſome other motive unknown to me, treading in the ſteps of the others, do no leſs cruelly devour us; I ſpeak of thoſe Gentlemen which accuſe us of overthrowing the Morals of Jeſus Chriſt by certain Doctrines which we teach; an unjuſt accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if ever there was one; for if we deſtroyed the Sanctity of the Goſpel, it muſt needs follow of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that that which we follow, muſt be pernicious; And how can it be that our Morals ſhould be corrupt, ſeeing it produceth a Holy Diſcipline, whoſe Rules and Directions are ſo many marks of the Maxims of true Morality; I will not be the Judge, I deſire they would only read what I have writ to prove the reſemblance of our Diſcipline with that of the Ancient Churches, and I am perſwaded that reading it without prejudice, they will freely confeſs that my parallels are juſt, and that I have drawn the Picture ſo like the Original, that 'twill be hard to know the one from the other, there's ſo much reſemblance betwixt them; after which, I may be permitted to infer from the Holineſs of our
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:63628:13"/>Diſcipline, the ſanctity of our Morals; and from the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Morals, and of our Diſcipline, the truth of our Doctrine, and by conſequence, the purity of our Religion.</p>
            <p>I know 'tis not abſolutely impoſſible but that there might be a corrupt Moral, with a good Doctrine; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho ordinarily theſe things march together, and that the ſanctity of the one is followed with the purity of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nevertheleſs it may ſo happen that ſome may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to joyn a pure Doctrine with a corrupt Moral, or a holy Moral with dangerous Doctrines. Nevertheleſs, becauſe the Moral naturally follows the Doctrine, that for the moſt part an Orthodox Doctrine produces a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Moral, and that when the Doctrines are true, the Laws of the Moral are juſt; I allow that thoſe which belch out falſe accuſations againſt us, as Enemies of the Morals of Jeſus Chriſt, I deſire they would judge of our Doctrines by our Morals, becauſe then they would judge of our Morals by our Diſcipline; for there's nothing more juſt, than to judge of the one by the other. If our Diſcipline then be pure, 'twill follow that our Moral is holy, and by conſequence our Doctrine is true by their own confeſſion. If they ſay that our Diſcipline is not pure, they accuſe of impurity that of the Primitive Church, ſeeing ours is a faithful Copy and Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; if they confeſs it is good, then they muſt confeſs that all our Religion is pure, ſeeing its Doctrine is true, the Moral holy, and the Diſcipline blameleſs.</p>
            <p>They may forbear then writing ſuch great Volumes to vent untruths, nor take ſuch wide circuits to build on ill Principles, and to draw falſe and unjuſt conſequences; for there's nothing falſer than what they write, that we deſtroy the Moral of Jeſus Chriſt by our Doctrine of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; I ſay illegitimate, for if the very conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they impute to us might be drawn from our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:63628:14"/>which cannot be, yet they could not in equity be imputed to us, becauſe that, far from owning them to be ours, we abhor them with our Souls. What have we done to thoſe Gentlemen, that we ſhould be the object of their malice and ſpight? Where is the gentleneſs and moderation which the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt inſpires? Where is that Chriſtian Charity that thinks no harm? Would they recover at our charge what they have loſt? Would they be receiv'd into favour by our prejudice? and make us a Sacrifice to appeaſe a Party that would ſuppreſs them, and againſt which they are no longer able to reſiſt? Muſt they needs quarrel with us becauſe they could not ſucceed in their deſigns? Heaven does not proſper mens endeavours, when the fleſh has as great a ſhare in it as the Spirit, when we mingle our Intereſt with thoſe of God; when we make Religion ſerve the World, and when we go about to make I know not what mixtures of the Onions and Garlick of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with the Milk of <hi>Canaan.</hi> The time will come when we ſhall all appear before the dreadful Tribunal, upon which ſhall ſit an Incorruptible Judge, who reading in our hearts, and ſearching into the bottom of our Souls, will make us give an account of our moſt ſecret thoughts, of our words and our actions; and happy will thoſe be whoſe Conduct, was ſincere and whoſe actions had Faith and Charity for their Principle, and the glory of God for their End.</p>

                     <p>Jeſus Chriſt having eſtabliſhed the Preaching of the Goſpel, to conduct his Children to the enjoyment of the Salvation which he purchaſed for them by the Merits of his Death, it is with great Reaſon that the Authors of our Diſcipline have begun this Excellent Work, with the Articles which Treat of the Election and Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miniſters, which are the Inſtruments which God employs <hi>for aſſembling the Saints, and for building up the Body of Chriſt,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks. The more weighty this Office is, the more care ought to be taken, that thoſe which are called to it ſhould be enrich'd with Gifts neceſſary to diſcharge themſelves as they ought; that's to ſay, <hi>That they ſhould be apt to teach;</hi> which the National Synod of <hi>Gergeau,</hi> added in the Year 1601. to the Article which we examin, after theſe Words, <hi>of their Doctrine:</hi> 'Tis true, that the purity of Doctrine ſhould be accompanied with Holineſs of Life, to the end, that if they are the Light of the World by their Preaching, ſo alſo they ſhould be the Salt of the Earth by their good Living. The Apoſtle, who perfectly knew the importance of this Divine Employment, took par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. of the 1ſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. to <hi>Titus,</hi> to preſcribe all the Qualities he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in a good and faithful Miniſter of the <hi>New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo Treats of them, but in a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral manner, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. of his 1ſt.

                     <p>I now proceed to the ſecond Head of this Article, which concerns the Teſtimonies thoſe are to produce, who are to be Conſecrated to the Holy Miniſtry.

                     <p>I will not here repeat what I alledged of the fourth Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> upon the firſt Article; I will only ſay, that in the third Tome of the Library of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and in the Pandect of the Cannons Printed at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> of late years, there is a Canonical Epiſtle of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the ſixth Canon of which treats of Ordinations, wherein he deſires, <hi>the Election and conſent of the Clergy, the examination of the Biſhop, and the teſtimony of the people.</hi>

<note place="margin">P. 236. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> 1642.</note> the Biſhop is to ſignifie to the People the Names of thoſe which are to be choſen, to the end that if any there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent know any thing that might hinder the Ordination, they might declare it freely, and with a ſafe conſcience;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63628:20"/>thence it is that <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt, deſires in theſe Occaſions, <hi>the teſtimony of the People,</hi> as he explains himſelf in his 89 Epiſtle.

<note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> the manner of Ordination; that is to ſay, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that he which deſires to receive it, may be adorn'd with the Qualities recommended by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and that he may be acceptable to all the world by his good Works.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> ſo highly approv'd this uſe and practiſe, as alſo the publiſhing which was made of thoſe which were to be admitted into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Church, whereof I ſhall ſpeak on the tenth Article,

                     <p>After what I have hitherto ſaid, it cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be doubted, but that in all times, thoſe have been Examin'd in the Church, which were to Labour for her Inſtruction and Edification, and which were to ſerve in Preaching the Word, and Adminiſtring the Sacraments; I grant this Examination may differ according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Places and Perſons, which were to do the Office of Examiners; ſome doing it with more Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Severity, and others with more Mildneſs and Charity; and I can't tell if ever there has been ſeen on this Subject, a more ſtrict and exact eſtabliſhment than that which our Diſcipline doth preſcribe: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, it is moſt certain, that is, That the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Life and Doctrine, however 'twas perform'd, always preceded Ordination.

                        <hi>The temerity of thoſe which being ignorant and deſtitute of knowledg, would preſume to take on them the Office of Paſtors, never conſidering that the Conduct of Souls, is the Art of Arts:</hi> That is to ſay, the Nobleſt and moſt Excellent of all the Sciences, and withal, the moſt Difficult, the moſt Intricate, and moſt Laborious, and by conſequence, requires more Study and Care than any other whatſoever. What a ſhame
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63628:22"/>would it be for a Paſtor, to ſpeak yet with the ſame St. <hi>Gregory,</hi>

                     <p>This laudable Cuſtom continued a long while after the Death of <hi>Gregory;</hi> but ſince the Ninth Century, the Examination of Paſtors was inſenſibly brought to ſo mean a State, that there needed not much Learning to Anſwer the Queſtions that were propos'd: And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, The greateſt part of the Vocation and Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe to whom the Care and Conduct of Souls was committed, conſiſted only in Shew and Ceremony, or at leaſt ſo little heed was taken of their Judgment and Capacity, that there was ſeen to grow in a little time, from a practiſe ſo different from that of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, that groſs Ignorance, which was the Spring and Cauſe of moſt part of the Evils and Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which have befaln the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church: Not but that ſeveral Rules have been made to redreſs this great Miſchief, but it had got too deep root: Beſides, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Authority had a greater ſhare in theſe promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than the Glory of God, and the Inſtruction of the People; eſpecially the Power of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who by degrees had gain'd to themſelves the greateſt part of Eccleſiaſtical Power, bethought themſelves about the XI.

                     <hi>Him whoſe Ordination ſhall be ſignified to the Church, ſhall Preach the Word Three ſeveral</hi> Sundays <hi>in publick; (but not Adminiſter the Sacraments, nor Celebrate Marriage) in preſence of all the People, that they may obſerve his manner of Teaching: The ſaid People being expreſly warn'd, That if there be any one that know any juſt cauſe, wherefore the Election of him ſo ſignified, may not be fully ratified, or that he be not liked of, they may come and make it known to the Conſiſtory, who will patiently hear any one's Reaſons, to judge of the whole. The ſilence of the People ſhall be look'd upon as a full conſent: But if there be murmuring, and that the Party named, is liked of the Conſiſtory, and not of the People, or the major part of them, his admiſſion ſhall be deferred, and the whole ſhall be reported to the Colloqui, or the Provincial Synod, to diſcern, as well the Juſtification of the Perſon named, as of his Reception; and altho' the Perſon named was there juſtified, yet he ſhall not be impos'd as a Paſtor on the People, contrary to their deſire, nor ſo much as to the diſlike of the greateſt part of them; nor the Paſtor in like manner againſt his will, to the People; and the difference ſhall be clear'd by order, as aboveſaid, at the Charge and Expence of the Church which ſhall demand it.</hi>

                     <p>Although a Miniſter might be judged capable by the Synod, or the Colloqui, which have Examin'd him, That is not ſufficient to Eſtabliſh him. It is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over requiſite that the Flock that is appointed for him, be ſatisfied with his Preaching; therefore he is obliged to Preach Three ſeveral times, before he receives the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63628:23"/>Impoſition of Hands, to the end, that if his way of Preaching pleaſe the People, he may be confirm'd in his Miniſtry; but on the other hand, if all the People, or the major part of them declare, That they are not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his Preaching, and that his Teaching is not to their liking, Our Diſcipline doth very prudently Order, that all ſhall ſurceaſe. In effect, as a Miniſter cannot be forced to yield his Service to a Church, for the which he has no inclination; ſo in like manner, a Church cannot be obliged to make uſe of the Miniſtry of a Man, whoſe Conduct and Preaching is not accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is a kind of Wedlock, which requires the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal liking of both Parties;

                        <hi>There is nothing more firm and profitable,</hi> (<hi>ſaid to this purpoſe,</hi> Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen) <hi>than to receive freely the overſight of thoſe you receive as your Teacher or Guide; and ſee here the Reaſon he alledges for it: Our Law</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeaking of the Canons of the Church) <hi>requires not that People ſhould be led by force, it deſires that all ſhould be done of free-will, and without conſtraint.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And becauſe it often happens, that Miniſters give no cauſe on their part, for the refuſal made of their Miniſtry by the Churches, although 'twas appointed for them, and that this refuſal has no other ground, but the humour of an inconſtant People; the Ancient Canons have provided, in declaring that theſe Paſtors ſhall partake of the Honour of the Office and Function of a Miniſter; and that the Provincial Synods ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them ſome ſettlement elſewhere. The 18th Canon of the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the Year of our Lord, 341. is clear in the Caſe; <hi>If a Biſhop go not to the Church for which he was Conſecrated, and that it don't happen through his fault, but by the oppoſition of the People, or for ſome other ſubject for which he is not the Cauſe; Let him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63628:24"/>of the Honour, and of the Miniſtry, provided he cauſes not any trouble to the Church whither he retires; and let him take what the Synod of the Province ſhall judge conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</hi> All the difference there is to be ſeen betwixt this Canon and the Article of our Diſcipline, is, That then the Paſtors which were ſent to the Churches, had already received Ordination; whereas amongſt us, it is to be receiv'd in the Church it ſelf whither one is ſent: Nearer to which there cannot a greater Conformity be deſired. The 36th Canon of thoſe father'd on the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, preſcribes in effect, the ſame as that of <hi>Antioch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After all, by this Order of the Canons, Paſtors could not be impoſed on the Churches againſt their liking; ſo it is that Pope <hi>Celeſtin</hi> writes in the 5th Century, to the Biſhops of the Provinces of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and of <hi>Narbona, Let no Biſhop be given to thoſe which oppoſe his Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

                        <hi>We forbid the Laity to intermedle by themſelves or any elſe, in the Election of a Biſhop, or of any other Church Guide.</hi> And in all likelihood, the Council made this Decree in regard of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> who doubtleſs followed the Ancient practice, and with whom the Legates of this ſame Pope had a Conference in the City of <hi>Mountreall</hi> near <hi>Carcaſſone,</hi> three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereof there is mention made in the 18th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the 2d part of the Hiſtory of the Euchariſt.

Nevertheleſs, becauſe theſe kind of actions ſhould be free, and that the work of the Lord ought to be without conſtraint, it cannot reaſonably be uſed towards thoſe which refuſe to accept this Office, whatever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination they had to it before; according to which the third Council of <hi>Orleance</hi> aſſembled <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 538. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges the Paſtors which were choſen into Orders by force, or againſt their will; it diſcharges them from their Employment, without debarring them from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;

Joh. 20.21. 1 Cor. 4.1, 2. 2 Cor. 5.18, 19, 20. 1 Tim. 1.2, &amp;c. <hi>and others the like, exhorting each one to beware, to the end that as well the Miniſter as the People, diſcharge their Duty: The Miniſter diſcharging himſelf ſo much the more carefully of his Employment, as he knows 'tis precious and excellent in the ſight of God; and the people receiving with all reverence the Word of God, which ſhall be delivered by him, which is ſent unto them. Then ſhall be read in the preſence of all what is written,</hi> 1 Tim 3. Tit. 1. and 1 Pet. 5. <hi>where the Apoſtle teaches what a Miniſter ſhould be.

                     <p>There are ſeveral Conſiderations to be made on this Article, and on the form which is above recited. In the firſt place, the Miniſter to whom it belongs to Preach, ought in his Sermon, to treat of the Inſtitution and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Miniſtry, and of the duties of this weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Office; whereupon we find a great many excellent paſſages in the Writings of the Ancient Fathers of the Church, and ſeveral holy reflections capable to infuſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paſtors an ardent zeal, and a ſincere affection, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the ſeveral Duties of their Office. Not to ſpeak of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt, having compos'd an intire Treatiſe to explain the Functions of this Excellent Office; and it is very probable that in the time of Ordination it was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd to thoſe which were to receive it, whereunto the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63628:27"/>conduct of ſouls which God committed to their charge, obliged them: The firſt Canon of the fourth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> inſinuates it thus, having touched all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things about which he will have him examin'd which is to be eſtabliſh'd in the Miniſtry,
<note place="margin">Tom. 1. Concil. p. 727.</note> he adds, <hi>When he has receiv'd the Epiſcopacy in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, let him not follow his pleaſures, nor the inclinations of his mind, but let him ſubmit and acquieſce to theſe Decrees of the Fathers.</hi> And I make no doubt but what was practic'd in <hi>Africa</hi> in the time of this Council in the Ordination of Biſhops, did tacitly warn them of their Duty; for we find in the ſecond Canon, that two Biſhops laid on his head the Book of the New Teſtament, and held it there during the whole action; we read almoſt the ſame thing in the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under the Apoſtles Names, and in the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, and in the XI. Chap. of the ſecond Book of <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> his <hi>Rational,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> or rather ſome one elſe in his name, teaches in the Homily, that there is but one Legiſlator of the Old and New Teſtament; he teaches, I ſay, that the reaſon wherefore this Ceremony was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd in the Ordination of Biſhops, was to mind them, that to be Rulers over others, they were ſubject never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs themſelves to theſe Divine Laws, and oblig'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its Commands. Moreover, it appears by all I have ſaid, that the Author of the Book of Divine Offices, which is falſly attributed to <hi>Alcuin</hi> Tutor to <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> and to <hi>Amalarius Fortunatus,</hi> who liv'd in the time of <hi>Lewis le De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonair,</hi> it appears they were deceiv'd, when they ſaid the former in the 37th. <hi>Chap.</hi> and the other in <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. of the Book of Fccleſiaſtical Offices, that this Ceremony which I have touched, was not countenanc'd by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Ancients.</p>

<note place="margin">Tom. 4. p. 192. <hi>Paris</hi> 1623.</note> St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith poſitively on the 58th. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah, That Ordination is compleated not only by Prayer, but alſo by the laying on of hands. Theodoret</hi> in the 19th. <hi>Chap.</hi> of his Religious Hiſtory, in the third Volume of his Works, Printed at <hi>Paris</hi> Anno 1642, <hi>Theodoret</hi> joyns theſe two actions together, to wit, Impoſition of Hands, and Prayer; as things which ſhould not be ſeparated in the Ordination of Paſtors. Twenty five years ago the Letters of <hi>Photius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople-</hi> in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Century, were Printed at <hi>London,</hi> and at the end of theſe Letters, five more of this ſame Patriarch were ſubjoyn'd, which were taken out of an ancient Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Manuſcript, in the fourth of which Letters, he declares that Hands were not impos'd on a Biſhop, <hi>But to implore the Grace of the Holy Spirit which is needful for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63628:28"/>a Miniſter.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tom. 4. Conc. 525 Ibid. pag. 531 To 1. Conc. Gal.</note> It is doubtleſs upon this account that the Council of <hi>Sarragoſa</hi> in the year 592, <hi>Can.</hi> 9 calls this <hi>the Benediction;</hi> as alſo the fourth of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the firſt of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> in the year 599. <hi>Can.</hi> 3. <hi>The Bleſſing of Conſecration.</hi> The firſt of <hi>Orleans,</hi> Anno 511. <hi>Can.</hi> 10. ſpeaks <hi>of the Benediction of the laying on of hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This third Conſideration opens the way to us for a fourth, which regards the poſture of him which is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, and of him which Conſecrates. It may eaſily be obſerv'd from what has been ſaid, that him which Conſecrates is ſtanding, and him which is Conſecrated kneeling, otherwiſe it had been hard and almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to lay his hands on him, and to pray to God, holding them on his head, to the end he would be pleas'd libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to beſtow on him the Gifts and Graces neceſſary, duly to diſcharge the Office wherewith he is honour'd. But were it ſo that the truth of this practice, which is very juſt, could not be gather'd from this Diſcourſe, <hi>Theodoret</hi> gives us no cauſe to doubt of it; for he obſerves in the 15th. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the fourth Book of his Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory, that when there was need of appointing a Succeſſor to <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Samoſatia,</hi> the Synod of the Province caſt their Eye on <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Nephew, and that after his Election he was led towards the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table, and there he was made to kneel down to receive the Impoſition of Hands.</p>
                     <p>It remains now to ſay ſomething of the Number of the Paſtors which are to be preſent at this Holy Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: The 4th Canon of the 1ſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points this ſhould be done by all the Biſhops of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; or if that cannot be, that there ſhould be three at the leaſt; the others, by their Letters, approving of the Ordination. The 19th of that of <hi>Antioch</hi> preſcribes partly the ſame thing, that is to ſay, it declares, That
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63628:29"/>'twere to be wiſhed that all the Biſhops of the Province could be preſent; but when there is any hindrance, it doth not ſpecify, as that of <hi>Nice,</hi> the number of thoſe which ought to be preſent; it only ſaith, That 'tis requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite there ſhould ſeveral be aſſiſting, or that ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by their Letters. The 1ſt of the Canons attributed to the Apoſtles, requires, <hi>That a Biſhop ſhould be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by two or three Biſhops.</hi> Thence it is, that though according to the direction of moſt part of the Canons, Three Biſhops were uſually employed for the Ordaining a Paſtor; nevertheleſs Examples are found different from this Cuſtom.</p>

Inſtances, of Biſhops being Ordain'd by laying on of Hands of one Miniſter,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63628:29"/>to which may be added the 19th Chapter of his Religious Hiſtory, and the 19th of the 8th Book of <hi>Zozomen</hi>'s Hiſtory, which makes mention of two ſeveral Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made, or ready to be done, without any great neceſſity, by one ſole Biſhop, a great while after this Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> It is not then to be thought ſtrange, if our Diſcipline mentions but two, ſeeing alſo theſe two do repreſent the Synod or Colloque which deputed them, and that they do nothing but by virtue of the Power and Authority wherewith thoſe Bodies has inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; and that moreover one alone may ſuffice for a due Ordination, as we have juſt now proved. But before ending this matter, one difficulty which offers muſt be reſolv'd, to wit, if Hands may be laid on two Miniſters at once; for it ſometimes happens in our Churches, that two are called together, and ſome are in doubt, and deſire to know if one Miniſter can give them both Ordination at the ſame moment. To which I anſwer, That if one conſider the Original of this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and the Nature of the thing it ſelf, one may ſafely agree to lay hands on two Miniſters at once. As for the Original, and the Ceremony, every body knows it comes from Jeſus Chriſt, or rather from the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, which practiſed it before their Children were Maſters of <hi>Judea;</hi> and 'tis not to be doubted, but Jeſus Chriſt and the Apoſtles derived this Cuſtom thence when they us'd it. If it appears then that any of the Patriarchs bleſſed two perſons at once, in putting one hand on the head of the one, and the other hand on the head of the other, it ſeems to me one is ſufficiently Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoris'd to give Impoſition of Hands to two Miniſters at the ſame time. Now to know if the Patriarchs did ſo, you need only read <hi>Geneſis</hi> 48. where <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſed the two Sons of <hi>Joſeph</hi> purpoſely, ſetting his right hand on
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63628:30"/>the head of <hi>Ephraim</hi> which was the younger, and his leſt on the head of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> which was the elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>But to remove all doubt and ſcruple, it needs only caſt an eye, on the nature of the thing it ſelf, that's to ſay, on the Prayer, which is indeed what is the eſſential part of theſe kind of Actions, the impoſing of the hand or hands being only a bare exterior geſture, to deſign thoſe for whom the Bleſſing of God is implor'd, that it may reſt upon them, as one may ſo ſpeak, much after the ſame way as the hands do ſtay on their heads; now no body does queſtion, but that one may pray for two as well as for one; thence it is, that in <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory there is mention made,
<note place="margin">L. 1. c. 13. p. 34.</note> 
                        <hi>to receive Prayers by the hand,</hi> to ſignifie, to receive the Bleſſing of God by Prayer, and the laying on of Hands; ſo that in effect, 'tis as if he had ſaid, To receive the Bleſſing of God by Prayer, and the impoſition of Hands, as he ſpeaks in Chap. 1. Book 2. To conclude, The Ancients called this Ceremony, which they practiſed on ſundry occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<note place="margin">Tom. 7. l. 2. c. 26. de pecc. mor. &amp; rem.</note> I ſay, they called it, <hi>Prayers by the hand, or Prayers of the hand, or hands.</hi> Or as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> explains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſome of his Writings, <hi>The Prayer of Impoſition of Hands.</hi>

                     <p>As for Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, there are a great many Rules which oblige thoſe of the Clergy to obſerve the Canons, whereof the Diſcipline of the Ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians was made; ſo that neither Biſhop, nor Prieſt, nor Deacon, was admitted, who had not firſt ſubmitted to theſe Laws, and who did not acknowledg in ſubmitting to them, that 'twas by them he was to conduct the Souls which were committed to his care. I ſhould be too prolix to mention all the paſſages of Antiquity where Eccleſiaſticks are enjoyn'd to the practiſe of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and obſerving of the Canons; it ſhall ſuffice to mention ſome, to juſtfy a Truth acknowledged by all thoſe which have applied themſelves to the Reading the Works of Ancient Doctors, and eſpecially of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils;

The Fathers ſtop not there; for not content to have recommended to the Clergy the obſervation of the Canons, which alſo they have formally requir'd of them at the very moment of their Conſecration, it is in this manner the Fathers of the 4th Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> have explain'd themſelves in Canon 27. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 633. for they oblige the Prieſts and Deacons eſtabliſhed in Pariſhes,

But rightly to underſtand the ſenſe of the Canon, it muſt be obſerv'd that the Council calls abſolute <hi>Ordination,</hi> an Ordination which obliges not to any certain place; it is what the Greek terms import, uſed by him, which amounts juſt to what we ſay, <hi>to Elect without aſſigning a certain Flock.</hi> See here the terms of the Canon; <hi>You muſt not lay hands on any body, neither Prieſt nor Deacon, nor on any in Eccleſiaſtical Orders, unleſs him that is to receive Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been before publiſhed and named in ſome Church in the City or Country, or in ſome Martyrs Chappel, or in ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtry; and as for thoſe who are abſolutely eſtabliſh'd, the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod appoints, that the impoſition of hands be null, and that thoſe which received it, cannot ſerve in the Church; which ſhall reflect on thoſe which had done it.</hi>

                     <p>The Preaching of the Word being the principal duty of the Holy Miniſtry, the Compilers of our Diſcipline have taken particular care exactly to preſcribe to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the Subject and Manner of doing it; theſe are the two things contain'd in this great Article; As to what regards the Subject of their Sermons, it muſt always be taken in the Holy Scripture; The Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> calls it, <hi>The Diſpenſation of the Word of Faith,
<note place="margin">Can. 12.</note> and of the right and true Word;</hi> and it is with regard hereunto,
<note place="margin">Tom. 1. Concil. p. 728. Tom. 4. Concil. p. 820.</note> that of <hi>Carthage,</hi> Ann. 398. appoints in the 20th Canon, <hi>That the Biſhop ſhould apply himſelf only to Reading, Prayer, and Preaching of the Word of God.</hi> The Council of <hi>Tolledo,</hi> aſſembled in the Year of our Lord 675. employs the 2d of its Canons to preſcribe to Paſtors their Duty, ſaying, They ſhould always have in their mouth the Sword of Truth, be powerful in exhorting by holy Doctrine, and to convince Gainſayers; and not to turn aſide from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Scriptures, ſeeing they have received the Office of Preachers: And having obſerv'd that the dumb Miniſter is not fit to inſtruct his Flock, The Aſſembly declares, That the true Paſtor ought to find out thoſe who are under his care, either to inſtruct them without arrogance, if they are ignorant;
<note place="margin">Tom. 1. Conc. <hi>Gall.</hi> Ibid. c. 3, &amp; 10.</note> or to rejoice with them for the progreſs they have made in the knowledge of the Myſteries of their Salvation. The Council of <hi>Reims,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 813. enjoins Biſhops and Paſtors in the 14th Canon, <hi>To preach the Word of God to all the World.</hi> The VIth of <hi>Arles,</hi> in the ſame year, requires that all the buſineſs of Biſhops ſhould be Inſtruction, and Preaching, becauſe Ignorance is the Mother of all Errors; and that the Word of God ſhould be taught, not only in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63628:35"/>Cities, but alſo in the Pariſhes. In the Year 858. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tours,</hi> made a Capitulary, taken out of Ancient Canons, in the 9th of which he appoints, <hi>That Prieſts ſhould preach to all the Faithful,

                     <p>If after the Decrees of Councils, we conſult the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctors, they will alſo teſtify, that Miniſters are particularly called to Preach the Goſpel, and to declare to their Hearers the word of Truth; <hi>My Sheep,</hi> ſaid to this purpoſe <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,
<note place="margin">Orat. 25. p 440.</note> My Sheep hear my voice;</hi> that is to ſay, that which I have received from the Divine Oracles, which I have preached ever after one manner throughout the whole courſe of my life, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the Times, and which I will never forbear to preach;
<note place="margin">Tom. 4. p. 266.</note> and St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in his 3d Book of Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon the 16th Chapter of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Paſtors to teach;</hi> it is what the putting the Bible on their head at their Ordination ſhould put them in mind of.</p>
                     <p>This will appear yet more plainly, if after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd the Subject and Argument of Miniſters Preaching the Goſpel, we alſo examine the Matter, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Diſcipline, ſhould be plain, conformable to the Scripture, fit to Edify, free from intricate School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtions, and from all Oſtentation. Let us now inquire if the Ancient Chriſtians did otherwiſe. The Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63628:35"/>Capacity of each perſon in giving Milk to ſome, and ſtrong Meat to others; and in the 7th <hi>Hom.</hi> upon <hi>Joſhua,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ibid. l. 2. p. 393.</note> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes to ſhun the beauty, pomp, and ornament of Rhetorical Philoſophers, Poets, and Writers of the Age, of whom <hi>Valentine, Baſilides,</hi> and <hi>Marcian,</hi> learn'd their Hereſies: In the 9th Book of his Commentaries on the 12th <hi>Chap.</hi> of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he ſaith, So much care muſt not be taken to pleaſe the Hearers, as to work on their Affections, and to inſpire into them the love of Vertue; obſerving on this occaſion, that it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the moſt Eloquent and ſublime Preachers, only tickle the Ears with pleaſing words of humane Learning, but do not work on the heart; whereas many times thoſe which ſtudy plaineſs, and preach without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, convert many to the Faith, humble the Proud, and bring Sinners to repentance.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Buſil</hi> in his Morals, ſaith ſeveral things which agree very well with the Article, whoſe conformity we ſeek to find with the ancient Diſcipline of the Primitive Chriſtians: For Example,
<note place="margin">Tom. 2. Reg. 70. C. 5, 6, 7, 23, 26.</note> 
                        <hi>That one muſt not teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than we have learned in the Goſpel; that we muſt preach all things our Saviour has preſcrib'd to us in the Goſpel, and by the Miniſtry of his Apoſtles, and all things conformable to them; That thoſe to whom the preaching of the Goſpel is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſhould not conceal any thing which is pleaſing to God, fearing leſt they ſhould render them elves guilty of the death of thoſe which periſh; That the Word of God muſt not be preach'd for Oſtentation, nor flatter thoſe which hear it, the more to ſerve our own Pleaſure or Conveniencies; but act as if we ſpoke for the glory of God in his preſence; and that to preach the Goſpel one muſt not make uſe of any Prerogatives or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that ſhould advance us above others, fearing leſt the grace of God ſhould be fruſtrated thereby.</hi> There can nothing in the World be ſeen more conformable to our Diſcipline.</p>

                     <p>In the main, all I have ſaid on this Article is grounded on the Precepts and Example of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> I ſay on his Precepts,

                        <hi>Hold faſt,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Timothy, the form of ſound words which thou haſt heard of me, in faith and love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus.

<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. &amp; 2.14.</note> I ſay in the next place, according to his Example; for he declares, That Jeſus Chriſt ſent him not to Baptize, but to Preach; not with wiſdom of Words, nor with excellence of Speech; and that his Preaching was not in flattering words of humane Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

                     <p>It is not eaſie to affirm with certainty, if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons whereof they ſpeak were reduced into writing, or rather if they were not cuſtoms and uſes ſetled in the Churches by long practice; for this term of <hi>Canon or Rule,</hi> has ſometimes this ſignification in the writings of the Ancients; and what induces me to think ſo, is, That till the Fifth Century, when this requeſt was preſented, it was not very needful to make Canons to oblige Paſtors to reſide in their Churches, if it be not that one may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to this Reſidence the Canons which prohibit the Tranſlation of Biſhops from one place to another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſhall treat hereafter.</p>
                     <p>I know very well, that the Council of <hi>Sardis</hi> had in the year 347, made ſome Decrees which in ſome fort regarded Reſidence; but beſides that theſe Canons were not much known in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> they were not properly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63628:38"/>made for eſtabliſhing of Reſidence, nor preciſely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Biſhops thereunto, but only to inform them in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſing it as an indiſpenſible Obligation, in what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and for what time they were permitted lawfully to be abſent from their Churches; in effect, in the eighth Canon, the Fathers of <hi>Sardis</hi> allow Biſhops may go to Court if the Emperor ſend for them, or if the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and defence of the Poor, of Widows, and Orphans oblige them to it: It is true, that in the ninth and tenth Canons they reſtrain the permiſſion granted in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and do not permit Biſhops to go themſelves to Court, but when they are called by the Prince; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they agree they may ſend one of their Deacons to obtain ſome favour in behalf of diſtreſſed perſons; but they conſent to it upon prudent and judicious reaſons, and which are to be lookt upon as neceſſary precautions againſt the ambition of Biſhops, to whom the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil poſitively forbid,
<note place="margin">Can. 14, 15.</note> 
                        <hi>To be abſent from their Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three Weeks, unleſs ſome preſſing neceſſity conſtrain them to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When under the ſecond Branch of our Kings, the Prince caſt his eye on any Biſhop to make him his Arch-Chaplain, he was forced to demand leave of the Synod and Pope,
<note place="margin">Con. <hi>Fran.</hi> cap. 55. Tom. 2. Conc. <hi>Gall.</hi> p. 217.</note> the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> having already got great power in <hi>France;</hi> I ſay he was forced in ſome ſort to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their leave to get him away from his Church, to have him near his perſon, becauſe every body was then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that Paſtors were bound in Conſcience to make their Reſidence in the midſt of their Flocks.</p>
                     <p>I believe Plurality of Livings, as is ſpoken at this time, has given a mortal blow to the caſe of Reſidency, and has by this means introduced ignorance into the Church, and together with Ignorance, Superſtition, which is the Daughter of Ignorance; this wicked cuſtom was a long
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63628:38"/>while unknown amongſt Chriſtians, ſeeing the firſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non which formally condemns it, is, if my memory fail not, the fifth of the ſixteen Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> aſſembled the year of our Lord 693. I confeſs that the tenth of the Council of <hi>Galcedon</hi> forbids Clerks to inrole themſelves in two Churches at once; but that of <hi>Toledo</hi> is formal on the matter I examin, <hi>That there be not granted to one Prieſt ſeveral Churches, becauſe he cannot do ſervice in all, nor help the People in the Priestly Functions.</hi> Since that time, this ſort of prohibitions have been frequent in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> as may be eaſily made appear, were this the place to do it; it ſhall ſuffice to alledg at preſent, the demand which <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth cauſed to be made by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> That but one Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice be conferr'd on one perſon, in taking away as to what regards Plurality, the difference of Benefices, Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibles, or Incompatibles, becauſe this diſtinction which is new, and unknown to ancient Decrees, has alſo occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd great Evils to the Catholick Church, and that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Benefices be given to Regulars, and Secular ones to Seculars, and that for thoſe which at preſent enjoy two or more, either that they hold only that which they ſhall make choice of in a little time, or that they ſuffer the puniſhments inflicted by the ancient Canons.</p>
                     <p>However it be, zeal being grown cold, and Paſtors abating in the care they formerly took in the Edification and Salvation of thoſe committed to their charge, there was an abſolute neceſſity of making Laws to enjoyn Reſidence; whereas formerly, they did it of their own free-will and inclination, to diſcharge their Conſciences of the Duties of their calling. Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Second, ſeeing in the Ninth Century they diſpenſed themſelves from dwelling with their flock,
<note place="margin">Coll. Rom. p. 2. c. 6, 7: p. 23, 24.</note> made a Decree in a Synod held at <hi>Rome,</hi> having this Title, <hi>That Biſhops do
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63628:39"/>not live out of their Dioceſſes;</hi> the Canon is conceiv'd in theſe terms, <hi>Biſhops ſhould keep always at their Churches, to labour with Piety for their edification, becauſe the abſence of the Biſhop many times becomes the misfortune of the People:</hi> And in the following Canon he will have Cloiſters built near the Churches for the Dwellings of inferior Clerks, to the end they may give attendance to the ſtudy of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Diſcipline. The Council of <hi>Meaux</hi> Anno 845,
<note place="margin">Tom. 3. Conc. <hi>Gal.</hi> c. 36 p. 42.</note> made another Ordinance much like it, <hi>That Prieſts be not ſuffer'd to lodg abroad where they liſt, but that they keep always at their Churches, by reaſon of Divine Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and to yield to Litanies the ſervices they owe to them; and that they have not liberty to dwell elſewhere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After abuſes had in this regard crept into the Church, it cannot be doubted but many Settlements were made to reſtore things to the ancient Model, and to ſhew the neceſſity and importance of it, becauſe in truth the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of Reſidency is greater than moſt people are aware of, ſeeing that Paſtors are obliged wholly to their Flocks, and all the parts of their Miniſtry is deſtin'd for them: Nevertheleſs whatever Decrees have been made to eſtabliſh the ancient Diſcipline, it could not be prevented, but in theſe latter ages an extream negligence has ſucceeded in the practice of ſo holy and ſacred a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom; therefore in the days of our forefathers, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of Non-reſidence was debated with much heat in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>

Seſſion, and in the Decree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, ſeems to have preſcribed ſome remedy to the evil which ariſes by Non-reſidence, but it did it in ſuch a manner, as it left the door open to the abuſe, which far from diminiſhing, has increaſed more and more.</p>
                     <p>But that there may not be any conteſt on occaſion of our Diſcipline, enjoyning Miniſters and their Families, to make actual reſidence in their Churches, that is, with their Wives and Children, as if the Ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were never Married, and as though they never lived in their Churches with their Families; it's neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to juſtify our Practiſe by ſome Examples: The firſt ſhall be that of the venerable old <hi>Cheremon,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nile</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> for <hi>Euſebius</hi> mentions in the 42d Chapter of the 6th Book of his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, That when the Perſecution of <hi>Decius</hi> raged, he retired into a Mountain with his Wife, who never forſook him: And in the 9th Chapter of the 8th Book, he makes mention of <hi>Phileas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Thmuis</hi> in <hi>Thebaide,</hi> who ſuffer'd Martyrdom under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> although the Judge which condemn'd him, did what he could poſſible to make him renounce Jeſus Chriſt, in exhorting him eſpecially to have pity of his Wife and Children. <hi>Spyridion,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Trimythunte</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> in the days of the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> liv'd in his Church with his Wife and Children, as is witneſſed by <hi>Zozomen;</hi>

                        <hi>We appoint by this Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, That the Ancient <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe be obſerv'd; and that each Biſhop viſit the Churches of his Dioceſs.</hi> The 35th of the 4th of <hi>Toledo,</hi> in the Year 633. renewed this Decree, with this Clauſe, <hi>That if the Biſhop were ſick, or employed elſewhere, he ſhould cauſe the Viſitation to be made by ſome of his Prieſts or Deacons:</hi> This reſtriction opened the door to the negligence of Paſtors, which did that by others, which they ſhould have done themſelves; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as had the Canon of <hi>Tarragona</hi> been leſt in its force, and without bringing any qualification to it, the Biſhops would not have failed punctually to have obſerved it. Nevertheleſs, the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in the 24th Seſſion,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63628:43"/>
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. of Reformation, made no difficulty to follow the mitigation of the Council of <hi>Tolledo,</hi> although it does but too much favour the ſtupidneſs of Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, which our Kings having mutually conſider'd, in the 9th Century, they made ſundry Ordinances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they enjoin'd Biſhops themſelves only, to viſit yearly their Dioceſſes, <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Capit.

                     <p>Therefore I proceed to the other Conſideration, To ſhew that a Biſhop had no right of inſpection, but on his own Dioceſs; beyond which he was not permitted to meddle. Thence it was that the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the Year 341. declares in the 9th Canon, That each Biſhop has power in his own Dioceſs, prudently to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it, and to take care of the whole Circuit which depends of the City where he dwells; and in the 22d Canon this Rule is made, <hi>That a Biſhop do not go to another City which is not under his Conduct, nor into any part of the Country which don't belong to him, there to Ordain any one, nor to ſettle Prieſts, or Deacons, ſubject to another Biſhop, if it be not done by conſent of the Biſhop of the place; and if there be any Biſhop ſo bold to do ſuch things, That the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination he has made, be void; and as for him, let him be cenſur'd by the Synod.</hi> And as this Council prohibits Biſhops to enterpriſe any thing without their Dioceſs; that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of the year 381. forbids it to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans out of their Provinces, Canon 2d.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Titles of Superiority which is diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by our Diſcipline, beſides that they are contrary to the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, and to the Equality which was at firſt amongſt Paſtors, the Church of <hi>Africa</hi> had in a manner baniſh'd them quite from amidſt of it,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63628:43"/>to incline the Biſhops to humility, and to remove from their minds, all thoughts of Pride and Ambition; for it made this Canon, which is the 39th in Mr. <hi>Juſtell</hi>'s <hi>African Code; Let none call Prince of Biſhops, or High Prieſt, or any thing of like nature, the Biſhop of the higheſt See; but let him only be called Biſhop of the firſt See.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Origen</hi> treats at large of theſe Duties of Paſtors in ſeveral parts of his Works, where he teaches how they ought to act in regard of themſelves, and in regard of thoſe committed to their care, towards whom they ſhould not ſhew too much indulgence, nor too much ſeverity; but open unto them the Gates of Heaven by their Doctrine and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not ſhut it againſt themſelves by a diſorderly and wicked Conduct: But eſpecially muſt be added, what he ſaith in the 7th Homily upon <hi>Joſhua;</hi> which is in the 1ſt Volume of his Works; and in the 25th upon St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> in the 2d Edition at <hi>Paris, An.</hi> 1514. St. <hi>Baſil</hi> lays down ſeveral Rules in his Morals, for the Conduct of Paſtors, whom, as he ſaith, ſhould be an Example unto others, and do in the firſt place, what they deſire others ſhould do, Preach the Goſpel with a holy freedom, and bear witneſs to it, although there might be ſome which forbid ſo doing, and perſecute to Death thoſe which do it. He will have them render God thanks for thoſe which are converted, and that they ſhould pray to God for them, to the end they may grow in grace dayly; That they ſhould have care not only of thoſe which are preſent, but alſo of the abſent; and that they ſhould omit nothing which may tend to their Edification and Salvation; deſiring they would therein Exerciſe themſelves conſtantly, as well in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick as private: He ſaith moreover, That the Miniſter ſhould be tender and full of compaſſion, eſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe whoſe Souls are mortally ſick; That he ſhould charitably contribute to their bodily neceſſities, without abuſing his power to the prejudice of thoſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63628:58"/>under his Conduct, and without exalting himſelf over them; but rather take occaſion to exerciſe humility towards them. He adds in concluſion, That he which is eſtabliſh'd in the Church to be a Guide to others, ſhould neither ſay nor do any thing, but with a great deal of prudence and circumſpection, to render himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the ſight of God, as if he were to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by their judgment and teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>I could alledge ſeveral other Doctors of the Church to confirm the ſame thing; but becauſe what I have ſaid, is ſufficient for eſtabliſhing this Truth, I proceed to the conſideration of what follows in the Article which we Examine, <hi>That it belongs to the Magiſtrate to have an Eye over Miniſters, and to take care they walk orderly in their Vocation,</hi> &amp;c. The good Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old Diſcipline, obliging the Miniſters of the Sanctuary to do their Offices, and Religiouſly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all things which pertain'd to the Service of God; under the Oeconomy of Grace, the Examples of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius,</hi> of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> of <hi>Marcien</hi>'s, of <hi>Leo</hi>'s, and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry others, which have aſſembled ſeveral Councils for the benefit of Chriſtian Religion, and to preſerve the Church from the Poiſon of Hereſies and Schiſms; I ſay, all theſe Examples do not in the leaſt ſuffer us to doubt, but that Princes and Sovereigns have right to ſuperviſe over Biſhops and Paſtors, and are bound in Conſcience to endeavour the advancement of the Glory of God, and the preſervation of his Worſhip in all purity: And not to go farther than our <hi>France,</hi> Who is there at this time but does know the diligence of our Kings on a great many occaſions; the many Councils they have Aſſembled, and to many of them have preſcribed the ſubject and matter of their deliberations, which is an authentick proof; and the Capitularies which we have ſtill

                     <p>I come now to Sickneſſes, and other like accidents, for the which we do not think fit a Miniſter ſhould be depoſed; we do not indeed in the firſt Ages of the Church find any Rule on this ſubject, becauſe in all likelihood, as yet none were found that would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to a Paſtor, (who by reaſon of Sickneſs could not diſcharge the Duties of his Calling) the name and quality of Paſtor, no more than things neceſſary for his ſubſiſtence.

                     <p>As for what regards Simony, which according to our Diſcipline deſerves depoſition, St. <hi>Baſil</hi> was of the ſame judgment, as he ſhews in the Letter which he writ to the Biſhops of his Dioceſs, and which in the new Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Printed in <hi>England,</hi> of the Canonical Epiſtles of the Holy Fathers, four years ago, makes the 91 Canon of this Holy Doctor.

                     <p>The crime of Treaſon and Rebellion, has not been omitted in our Diſcipline, being it furniſhes a juſt and more than ſufficient cauſe of depoſition. If any one, ſaith the 84th.

                     <p>As for deſerting their flocks, by Paſtors forſaking them without licenſe, it is puniſhed by the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the third Canon of the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the year 341; and by the tenth and twentieth of that of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> There remains ſomething to be ſaid of Schiſm, which commonly is attended with Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Eccleſiaſtical order, and with a diſregard of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veats and Remonſtrances, made to the Authors of theſe Partialities and Diviſions, by thoſe who have right and power to do it. The ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Ganges</hi> in <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> aſſembled <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 325. or as I think, much later, has this Decree, <hi>If any ſhall hold private Aſſemblies out of the Church; and if out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to the Church, they undertake to do that which ſhould be done in the Church only, without ſo much as having a Prieſt by conſent of the Biſhop, let him be Anathema.</hi> The 31ſt. of the Canons which go in the Apoſtles Names, pronounces ſentence of depoſition againſt a Prieſt who deſpiſing his Biſhop, altho he has done nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Juſtice and Piety, if he makes Aſſemblies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and raiſes Altar againſt Altar, doing after this manner, he manifeſts his Tyranny and Ambition; it's true he adviſes he ſhould be warn'd three times before he is degraded. The fifth Canon of the Council of <hi>Antioch</hi> is too remarkable to paſs it under ſilence: <hi>If a Prieſt or Deacon</hi> (ſays it) <hi>ſlighting his Biſhop, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating himſelf from the Church, makes a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion apart, and raiſes an Altar, and refuſes to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his Biſhop, when he recalls him, and don't prepare to pleaſe and obey him at the firſt nor ſecond time that he calls him, let him abſolutely be depoſed, without any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for his evil, nor recovery of his place and dignity; and if he continue to ſtir up troubles and ſeditions in the Church, let him be puniſhed by the Secular power, as a ſeditious
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63628:65"/>perſon.</hi> The firſt Oecumenical Council of <hi>Canſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> in the year 381, employs its ſixth Canon againſt thoſe which endeavour to confound and overthrow the Eccleſiaſtical Order. And the firſt Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> aſſembled in the year 431, deprives of all power over the Biſhops of the Province, and from all Eccleſiaſtical Communion, the Metropolitan, who ſeparating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the holy Oecumenical Synod, has, or ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Council and Aſſembly of Apoſtacy, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; and moreover declares him incapable of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing any Office, ſubjects him to all the Biſhops of the Province, and to all the Neighbouring Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, which make profeſſion of the Orthodox Faith; and to inhance his puniſhment, it degrades him from the Epiſcopacy. One may add to this Decree, the 3, 4, and 5th. Canons of the ſame Council.</p>
                     <p>Howſoever it be, Rebellion, and the contempt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, which for the moſt part accompany Schiſm and Diviſions, did not find in the Diſcipline of the Ancients more kind entertainment than in ours, ſeeing that after two or three Advertiſements and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, they proceeded, as has already been ſeen, to the degrading of obſtinate and rebellious Clergy-men. So it was done to <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> who was cited three times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was condemned, as is evident by the Acts of the firſt Council of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> It was alſo the manner of proceeding uſed againſt <hi>Macarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> a <hi>Monotholite,</hi> towards the end of the ſeventh Century: In the Sixth Oecumenical Council held at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> by the Emperor <hi>Constantine Pogonat,</hi> or the
<note n="*" place="margin">Great Beard.</note> Hairy; and it may be ſaid, 'twas the uſual practice of the Church. The 74th. Canon of the Apoſtles explains it ſelf at large, for it orders, when a Biſhop ſhall be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Biſhops ſhall ſummon him; and if he appears,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63628:66"/>and that he confeſſes, or is convicted of the crime he is accuſed of, they ſhall declare what puniſhment he has deſerved; but if being ſummoned, he don't appear, it requires to ſend two Biſhops to cite him a ſecond time; and if he fails again, that two others be ſent to cite him a third time; and if through contempt and rebellion, he refuſes to appear after thoſe three Citations, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the Synod to pronounce againſt him what they ſhall think fit, fearing leſt flying from judgment, he may think to have gained his Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>I almoſt forgot to have ſpoke a word of Dancing, and other Diſorders which are prohibited to our Miniſters, in the 47th. Article, which is very conformable to the 45th.

                     <hi>IN thoſe places where the Order of Diſcipline is not yet Eſtabliſhed, the Election as well of Elders as of Deacons, ſhall be made as well by the common voice of the People as of the Miniſters; but where the Diſcipline is already eſtabliſhed, it ſhall pertain to the Conſiſtory with the Paſtors, to make choice of the fitteſt Perſons, by ardent Prayers, to that effect; And the Parties ſhall be expreſly nominated publickly in the Conſiſtory; and to thoſe which ſhall be choſen, the Office ſhall be read, to the end they may know the buſineſs they are to be employed in. If they conſent to it, they ſhall afterwards be nominated to the People two or three Sundays, that ſo the conſent of the People may alſo intervene; and if there be no oppoſition the third</hi> Sunday, <hi>they ſhall be publickly admitted by ſolemn Prayers, they ſtanding before the Pulpit, and ſo ſhall be ſetled in their Office, ſubſcribing the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, and the Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline; but if there be oppoſition, the Matter ſhall be decided in Conſiſtory; and if it cannot be there determin'd, the whole ſhall be tranſmitted to a Colloque, or Provincial Synod.</hi>

                     <p>Having treated of Miniſters, and the Schools where they ought to ſtudy to attain to the Office of the Holy
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63628:74"/>Miniſtry, it follows in order, to ſpeak of thoſe which partake with them of the care in Governing the Flock; That is, of Deacons, and Elders, which amongſt us are Secular perſons, ſerving in the Church, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from Miniſters; or to ſpeak with the Fathers, from the Clergy; it is then of theſe two ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and of their Election, that I am to treat, in examining this Article, according to the deſign and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Compilers of our Diſcipline.</p>
                     <p>I'll begin with the Deacons, which as every body knows, are of Apoſtolical inſtitution; In effect, we find in the 6th <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> That the Apoſtles giving themſelves up wholly to the Preaching of the Goſpel, they deſir'd the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to chuſe out certain perſons of good repute for Wiſdom and Piety, that they might commit unto them the care of the Poor, which they expreſs, <hi>by ſerving of Tables,</hi> that by this means they might the more conveniently attend to Prayer, and Preaching of the Word. St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerves on this place, that this was the firſt eſtabliſhing of Deacons, the very name not being till then known, that is, in the Chriſtian Church; as for the Jewiſh Church, they had their Deacons, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writes in the Hereſie of the <hi>Ebeonites,</hi> which is the 30th, they were called <hi>Azanites;</hi> and thence probably 'twas that the Apoſtles took the Original of Chriſtian Deacons; and they called them ſo, becauſe they ſerved at Tables, and at the diſtributing of Money to the Poor; It was to that time, thoſe which followed St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and wrote of the firſt inſtitution of Deacons, writing on the Acts of the Apoſtles, as <hi>Beda</hi> and <hi>Orcumenius,</hi> have refer'd it.</p>
                     <p>As for Lay-Elders, ſuch as ours be, I do not find their inſtitution in Scripture, as that of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63628:75"/>Deacons is found; as for the Elders of the Chriſtian Churches, whereof there is mention made in ſeveral places in the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> I am fully perſuaded that by them is to be underſtood Paſtors themſelves, which were called indifferently Elders, or Prieſts, and Biſhops; I do not except that famous paſſage, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. of the 1ſt Ep. to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is certain that theſe Elders were all of the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that is to ſay. They were all Paſtors; but becauſe there were ſeveral in the ſame Church, and that ſome were ſitter for Preaching the Word than others, they gave them different employments, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Gifts; in my judgment there needs no other proof of this Truth, than the right of Precedency which St. <hi>Paul</hi> attributes indifferently to all, which he would not have done, had they not been all of one Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; the <hi>Greek</hi> word alſo, which he uſes, ordinarily imports a precedency which is due only to Paſtors, which the Ancients frequently deſign by this name, particularly <hi>Juſtin Martyr.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding this, I make no queſtion, but the Original of our Elders is very Ancient, and that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches very near to the Apoſtles days, if they be not rather themſelves the Founders of them; and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms me in this Opinion is, that they eſtabliſh'd in the Church a Government like that of the Synagogue, a Chriſtian <hi>Presbytery,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> one; and as there were Elders amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> which had ſhare in Governing the Synagogue, it is very probable that there were alſo Elders amongſt the Chriſtians, People which had part in that of the Church, if not at the very firſt birth of Chriſtianity, at leaſt there was as ſoon as the number of them was increaſed in ſo great a manner; for then it was there was need of eſtabliſhing this ſort
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63628:75"/>of Government I have ſpoke of, and of which the Holy Pen-men have not mentioned the time of its ſettlement; becauſe it may be they had no particular occaſion of doing it, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> had of writing the Hiſtory of the Inſtitution of Deacons, which probably might alſo have been unknown to us, if the murmuring of the <hi>Greeks</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe their Widows were neglected at the ordinary Service, had not oblig'd him to tranſmit it in writing.</p>
                     <p>However it be, That it may not be imagin'd I only inſiſt on meer conjectures, and conjectures utterly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the Authority of Tradition, I'll produce the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Teſtimony of <hi>Hillary,</hi> Deacon of <hi>Rome,</hi> a Writer of the 4th Century, who ſpeaks in this manner.
<note place="margin">In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 1, 2. apud. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Tom. 3. p. 582.</note> 
                        <hi>The Synogogue, and the Church afterwards, had Elders, without whoſe advice nothing was done in the Church; and I can't tell by what negligence the ſame has been aboliſh'd, if it be not probably by the ſlothfulneſs of Doctors, or rather through their Pride, to make it be believ'd they are ſome-bodies:</hi> It appears plainly by theſe words of the Deacon <hi>Hillary,</hi> That the Church had her Elders, as well as the Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and that very early ſhe began to make uſe of them, when he began to write his Commentaries on St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles; for he complains of the aboliſhing this holy Cuſtom, which in all likelihood held a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time after its firſt inſtitution, and in the very place it ſelf where it was extinct by the negligence and malice of vain and ambitious Men; which doth juſtify, as I take it, what I have ſaid of its Antiquity, that is to ſay, That the firſt eſtabliſhing of it was by the Apoſtles, or at leaſt by their immediate Succeſſors, if it were ſo that we could not find the Footſteps in the Monuments of Eccleſiaſtical Writers, that immediately followed the Age of the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:63628:76"/>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, who knows but <hi>Claudius, Ephebius, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius, Biton,</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> which St. <hi>Clement,</hi> Diſciple of the Apoſtles, ſent to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> with the Excellent Letter which he wrote to appeaſe the troubles wherewith it was agitated; who, I ſay, can tell but they were of thoſe Elders whoſe original In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution we ſeek for? for he ſays nothing at all which may induce us to think they were either Paſtors, or Deacons. Moreover, in the third Century, <hi>Firmilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſaria</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and one of the moſt celebrated Prelates of his time, makes mention of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which he joyns with Paſtors, for the treating of affairs which concerned the good and edification of the Churches,

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63628:76"/>Communion of the Church a good part of the People, and began the Schiſm of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> which prov'd ſo deſtructive to the Churches of <hi>Africa.</hi> And what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly proves they were Lay-Elders like ours, is, that <hi>Optatus</hi> expreſly diſtinguiſhes them from <hi>Botrus,</hi> and <hi>Celeſius,</hi> which were of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and who not attaining to the Degree of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, to which their ambition made them aſpire, they herded with theſe corrupt Elders, together with <hi>Lucilla,</hi> a factious and powerful Woman, who of a long time endeavoured the ruin of <hi>Cecilian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>See here already ſufficient Arguments of the truth of the matter we examine; nevertheleſs becauſe many do imagin that our practiſe in regard of Elders, is new and unknown to the ancient Church, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to inſiſt a little longer on this ſubject, and to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg farther proofs, the better to eſtabliſh the Antiquity of the practiſe which we defend. I'le begin with the Acts of Juſtification of <hi>Cecilian,</hi> and of <hi>Foelix</hi> of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonge,</hi> his Ordainer, which are at the end of <hi>Monſieur de Laubeſpine</hi> Biſhop, of <hi>Orleans,</hi> his Notes on <hi>Optatus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mileva</hi> in <hi>Numidia.</hi> In theſe Acts, which are ancienter than the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things which directly regard our Subject, as what is ſaid on occaſion of Money given by <hi>Lucilla</hi> a Woman of Quality, to have made <hi>Majorinus</hi> Biſhop,

                     <p>Now it follows, I muſt treat of the form and manner of Electing our Deacons and Elders. The Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I examin, diſtinguiſhes the places where the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is not yet ſetled, from thoſe where it is already received; in the former it requires Election ſhould be made by the Votes of the People and Paſtors: In the other, it appoints, that nomination ſhall be made in the Conſiſtory, and that it ſhall be ſignified to the People, to have either their conſent, or their refuſal; becauſe their Eſtabliſhment depends on the liking and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People; the nomination made in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, no way depriving the People of their Right, ſeeing the moſt part of thoſe which do it, that is to ſay, the Elders and Deacons, do repreſent the People, and are inveſted with its power and rights. It is therefore of the People, either mediately, or immediately, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the Eſtabliſhing of Elders and Deacons amongſt us. And herein our Diſcipline has Religiouſly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the practice of the holy Apoſtles, who referred to the liberty of the People, the Election of the Seven Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons; the Hiſtory whereof is mentioned by St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the 6th. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Acts.</hi> And 'tis not only in regard of Deacons the Apoſtles proceeded in this manner, they would alſo that the whole Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould have ſhare in Eſtabliſhing <hi>Matthias,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 1.</note> who by common conſent was added to the Number of the Eleven Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and when they Ordained ordinary Paſtors, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they did it by the advice of the Aſſemblies of the People, to the conduct of whom they intended to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them. Which example the ſucceeding Chriſtians imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated very exactly, as we have made appear on <hi>Artic.</hi> 4. of the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> Our Diſcipline does not therefore preſcribe any thing as to what regards the Election of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63628:78"/>our Elders and Deacons, but what is very conformable to the practice of the Apoſtles, and to that of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians; in ſhort, if in the firſt Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity the People had a good ſhare in the Vocation of Miniſters, of greater reaſon had they in Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Elders, which were, if it may be ſo ſaid, the Executors of their Will, and the diſpencers of their Rights. And if our Miniſters by the ninth Article of the firſt Chapter, are obliged to ſign our Confeſſion of Faith, and Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, agreeable to what was practiced in the Primitive Church, it cannot be thought ſtrange, that we ſhould alſo oblige our Elders and Deacons to ſign them, becauſe they make up one body with the Miniſters of each Church, and do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with them of the conduct of the ſame Flocks.</p>

                     <p>It appears by <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> that the Office of Deacons is what our Diſcipline does repreſent, becauſe they were firſt of all appointed to ſerve at Tables; that is to ſay, to take care of the Poor. <hi>Oecumenius</hi> in his Commentaries on this Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> I now mentioned, obſerves expreſly, that they were appointed to diſtribute to Widows and Orphans, with care, the things neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence: According to which, the Enemies of <hi>Cecilian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> laid it to his charge as a great crime, That being Deacon, he hindered people from giving meat to the Martyrs, whereas he ought to have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them ſome himſelf.
<note place="margin">Faſcicul. rer. Expet. &amp; fug fol. 32. verſ.

                     <p>It is nevertheleſs true,
<note place="margin">Apolog. 2. pag. 99.</note> that in the time of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> it was the Paſtor that diſtributed the Money to the Poor, which was appointed for their Maintenance, which was given by Peoples Charity. But this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution in all likelihood was made by the Miniſtry of Deacons.
<note place="margin">Cap. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> indeed in his Apologetick declares, one had care of the Poor, of Orphans, of Old Folks, of thoſe which had loſt their Goods by Shipwrack, of thoſe which laboured in Mines, who were baniſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iſlands, or detained in Priſons for the Goſpel ſake;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63628:80"/>but he don't mention by whom it was done. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Cornelius</hi> its Biſhop, that is, about the middle of the third Century,
<note place="margin">Apud <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb.</hi> Hiſt. lib 6. c. 43. p. 244.</note> maintained above 1500 poor, as well Widows, as others, who were reduced to poverty, or afflicted with ſickneſs or infirmities. The charity of that of <hi>Antioch</hi> was no leſs conſpicuous than that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as we find by ſome of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Homilies on St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> particularly the 67, and 86th. It is true, we are not certain that the Deacons were charged with the care of theſe two Churches in the days of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom;</hi> but we know very well, the Deacons amongſt us attend on the things for which they were eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles; that is, that they ſhould take care of the Poor and Neceſſitous, according to their Primitive inſtitution. It was on this account that <hi>Fabian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> divided amongſt ſeven Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons in the third Century the fourteen Quarters of the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> that is to ſay, to the end they ſhould take care of the Poor which were in each of theſe Quarters, as is to be ſeen in the <hi>Roman</hi> Breviary on the 20th. day of <hi>January;</hi> and as <hi>Binnius</hi> obſerves in the Life of <hi>Fabian, Tom.

But what the Deacons did at firſt, was in time performed by the Miniſtry of <hi>Oeconoms</hi> and others, of which the ancient Canons make ſo frequent mention, in ſuch a way: nevertheleſs, that the Biſhop had the chief power in the diſtribution, which however was not done without the knowledg of theſe Deputies, when they had taken the place and office of thoſe firſt Deacons; and that it is ſo, I explain what <hi>Zozomen</hi> ſays of St. <hi>Epiphanius Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 27.

                     <hi>The office of Deacons is not to Preach the Word of God, and adminiſter the Sacraments: Nevertheleſs if neceſſity require, the Conſiſtory may chuſe certain Elders and Deacons to Cacechiſe in Families; as alſo it is permitted to Elders in abſence of the Paſtor to read Publick Prayers on working<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, being choſe by the Conſiſtory for that purpoſe; and that they follow the uſual form, in Reading the Canonical Books of the Old and New Teſtament.

                     <p>What I have ſaid of the Office of Deacons, doth highly juſtifie the Prohibition here made them of Preaching the Word of God, and adminiſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, becauſe they were not thereunto appointed; as <hi>Oecumenius</hi> has obſerved on <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles;</hi> the words whereof we have alledged, in examining the precedent Article. I know very well, that <hi>Philip,</hi> one of the Seven Deacons eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles, Preached the Goſpel; but I ſay it was not in quality of a meer Deacon that he Preached, but by vertue of a particular vocation, whereby God made him a Herald of his Grace, and a diſpencer of his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63628:81"/>therefore he is qualified with the Title of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, in the 21. <hi>Chap. ver.</hi> 8. of the <hi>Acts;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 21.8.</note> I do not here mention his Preaching Chriſt at <hi>Samaria</hi> after the great Perſecution raiſed againſt the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> becauſe he did nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but what the others which were ſcattered abroad did elſewhere, by vertue of a general vocation which each Believer has right to exerciſe at certain times, and in certain places. As for Baptizing and inſtructing the Queen of <hi>Aethiopia</hi>'s Eunuch,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the Sacred Hiſtory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that <hi>Philip</hi> had an expreſs command by the Miniſtry of an Angel to do it. In the Primitive Church a Deacon was not permitted to Preach the Word whilſt they were Deacons, they muſt at the leaſt paſs from the Order of Deacon, to that of Prieſthood, to be qualified to Preach; I ſaid at the leaſt; for if in the Eaſt, Prieſts were ſuffered to Preach, it was otherwiſe in the Weſt, where Biſhops only performed that function for ſeveral Ages. The firſt Prieſt that Preached publickly in <hi>Africa,</hi> was St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> by the power granted to him by <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his Biſhop, who was by Birth a <hi>Grecian,</hi> which was found to be irregular, becauſe 'twas contrary to the uſe and practice of the Churches of <hi>Africa,</hi> as is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> in the Life of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> If amongſt us there's found a Deacon that was capable, and had a deſire to exerciſe the Miniſtry, he was made to paſs from one degree to another, and then might Preach the Word, and adminiſter the Sacraments; whereas Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons were not inſtituted at firſt to do the one nor the other.</p>
                     <p>In effect, if their firſt Inſtitution permitted them not to Preach, neither did it ſuffer them to adminiſter the Sacraments, for theſe two commonly go together; ſo that if prohibiting them Preaching, they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63628:82"/>in proceſs of time ſuffered to adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; beſides that things which were joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were ſeparated, they paſſed beyond the bounds of their Vocation. Thence it is that <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> a Writer of the tenth or eleventh Century, which I already have cited ſeveral times,
<note place="margin">Ubi ſupra.</note> confeſſes that the Deacons of his time were quite different from thoſe eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles, and an Order quite another thing than the firſt. In the days of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apolog. 2.</note> that is to ſay, in the ſecond Century, the Deacons diſtributed the Bread and Wine of the Sacrament after being Conſecrated by the Paſtor; which in all likelihood proceeded from a falſe Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation given of theſe Tables, for the ſervice of which, Deacons were appointed; for they were not Euchariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tables, but common Tables, where diſtribution was made of things neceſſary for the Maintenance of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and Orphans, and other poor People, and where perhaps Chriſtians made their Feaſts of Charity, which for a time was practiſed in the Church. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> ſomething later than <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Coron. c 3 p. 102.</note> teſtifies, the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt was received only from the hand of thoſe which preſided, that is, of Biſhops and Paſtors; in all likelihood 'twas at that time the practice of the Churches of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and a cuſtom which was not obſerved in all places. The third Canon of the Council of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> in the year 314, ſuffers Deacons which have done nothing unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy their degree, to diſtribute both the Symbols. But in the ſame year, the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> prohibits them in the 15th.
<note place="margin">Tom. 1. Conc. <hi>Gall.</hi> Ibid.</note> Canon by that term to offer, which he emplies, is taken to adminiſter, according to the Explication which is given it by the 15th. Canon of the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> on the ſame place. The year 462, the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> forbids them ſimply to give the Euchariſt to Prieſts.
<note place="margin">Can. 18.</note> The 25th. Canon of that of <hi>Laodicea</hi> ſeems to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63628:82"/>forbid them abſolutely to diſtribute the Bread and the Cup; <hi>It ought not to be, that Miniſters,</hi> ſaith the Council, <hi>ſhould diſtribute the Bread, nor that they ſhould bleſs the Cup.</hi> At that time the term of Miniſters implied commonly the name of Deacons; but in the Canons of this Council it denotes a more inferior Order, <hi>viz.</hi> Subdeacons. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, it muſt be granted, that we have innovated no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Deaconſhip; and that our Deacons have always kept within the juſt bounds of their firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was to ſerve at Tables, and to take care of Widows, as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> obſerves in his 85 Epiſtle.</p>

                     <p>It cannot be denied, but great abuſes are committed, and that at all times there has been abuſes committed in the Church, upon account of Atteſtations and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies granted to thoſe of the ſame Communion which deſire to go from one place to another, to the end they might be known to be Members of the ſame Church, and to be aſſiſted in caſe of neceſſity. The Primitive Chriſtians endeavour'd to remedy theſe inconveniencies two ways; The firſt, By ordering that each Church ſhould maintain their own Poor.

                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:63628:85"/>
                     <p>As to the former of theſe two Means,
<note place="margin">Can. 85, &amp; 101. Tom. 1. Concil. p. 730.</note> the 4th Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in the Year 398. declares, <hi>That the Poor and Ancient people of the Church ought to be more aſſiſted than any others; and that young Widows, who are weak of Body, ſhould be maintain'd at the charge of the Church to which they belong.</hi> In the 2d Council of <hi>Tours,</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <hi>An.

<note place="margin">Tom. 1. Conc. <hi>Gall.</hi> p. 332.</note> as all the Farmers which dwell there, do each nouriſh their own Poor, to the end they may not ſtray and wander about to other Towns.</hi> In the 3d Council of the ſame place, aſſembled in the Year 813. there are ſeveral directions in this matter; for the Fathers command in the 11.16. 36. Canons,
<note place="margin">Tom. 2. Conc. <hi>Gal.</hi> pag. 297, 298, 302.</note> 
                        <hi>That Biſhops ſhall be permitted to take out of the Church ſtores, according to the Canonical Rules, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Prieſts and Deacons, what ſhall be neceſſary to maintain the Family and Poor of the Church; That the Tythes which ſhall be given to particular Churches, ſhall be diſtributed with great care by the Prieſts, according to the Biſhops Order, for the uſe of the Church and the Poor. That it be made known to all the World, that every body ſhould endeavour at all times to maintain their Family and the Poor; becauſe 'tis a wicked and impious thing in the ſight of God, that thoſe which enjoy great Riches, and that abound with all manner of Wealth, ſhould not help and aſſiſt thoſe which are in want and miſery.</hi> It is to what alſo amounts the 14th Canon of the 6th Council of <hi>Arles</hi> in the ſame year, <hi>That each have care of their Poor in time of Famine,
<note place="margin">Ib. p. 271.</note> or any other neceſſity, becauſe 'tis written, Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall obtain mercy.</hi> The Emperor <hi>Charlemain</hi> commanded the ſame thing, in the firſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63628:86"/>Book of his Capitularies,
<note place="margin">Pag 324. c. 11.</note> Chap. 121, 128, 132. and in another Capitulary he made after certain Synods he aſſembled in the year 813. and which is in <hi>Sirmond</hi>'s 2d <hi>Tome</hi> of <hi>French</hi> Councils. And I make no doubt, but this holy Diſcipline was Religiouſly practis'd in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, when people were full of Charity, when there was no need of compelling them to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it, by Authority of Canons and Humane Laws.</p>
                     <p>I proceed to the 2d Means which I propos'd, and which regards the Atteſtations and Certificates which ſhould not be granted but with much caution and circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to the end thoſe to whom they are given, ſhould not abuſe them in the places whither they go, or by the which they paſs; theſe kinds of Certificates were very frequent in the Primitive Church, where they were called <hi>Letters,</hi> to which was given ſeveral deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, according to the ſeveral Cauſes under which they were conſider'd; in regard of thoſe which wrote them, they were call'd <hi>Eccleſiaſticks;</hi> in regard of the relation which was betwixt thoſe which wrote them, and which receiv'd them, they had the name of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatory, or Paciſick;</hi> moreover, they were called <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,</hi> by reaſon of the Order which rendered them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and <hi>peculiar Letters,</hi> becauſe they were writ in certain Terms, and with diſtinct Marks as they bore, if it may be ſo ſaid, as had the very tokens of Chriſtian Charity.</p>
                     <p>But beſides all theſe reſpects, there was that of the perſons in whoſe favour theſe Letters were written, and then they were term'd in general, <hi>Letters of Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes mention in the 3d <hi>Chap.</hi> of the 2d Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> Nevertheleſs, this general Term has not hinder'd that in this laſt regard three ſorts has not ſometimes been made; in the firſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63628:86"/>place, there were <hi>Litterae Dimiſſoriae,</hi> Letters of Licenſe, by virtue of which, Eccleſiaſticks of one Church, were admitted to do the Functions of their Calling in another, and could even be receiv'd into their Clergy,
<note place="margin">Tom. 5. Concil. p. 327.</note> and be Members of it, provided they were abſolutely <hi>Dimiſſoriae,</hi> as appears by the 17th Canon of the 6th Oecumenical Council. Secondly, <hi>Litterae Commendatiae,</hi> Letters of Recommendation, which were given to ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Clerks, or to Lay-men which were ſeparated from the Communion, to the end, to recommend them as Believers, and as being out of the Cenſures of the Church. The 13th Canon of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> ſpeaks of the former, Where it forbids <hi>to ſuffer ſtrange and unknown Clerks to ſay Service in another Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having Letters of Recommendation from their Biſhops.</hi> And <hi>Zonaras,</hi> a famous <hi>Greek</hi> Canoniſt, makes mention of the latter, on the 11th Canon of the ſame Council, and on the 12th and 13th Canons of thoſe attributed to the Apoſtles.
<note place="margin">Cap. 9. Litt. A. p. 94.</note> The Frier <hi>Blaſtares</hi> makes almoſt the ſame remark in his Alphabetical Collection of Canons. To conclude, The Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> requires, that <hi>Letters Pacifick</hi> only, ſhould be given to the Poor. See here the manner it explains it ſelf in the 11th Canon; <hi>We appoint that all the Poor, and thoſe which have need of aſſiſtance, have in their Journeys, along with them, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Letters only Pacifick, and not Letters of Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; becauſe Letters of Recommendation ſhould not be given but to thoſe which are ſome way ſuſpected:</hi> Yet I obſerve this diſtinction han't always been kept, and that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the 7th Canon, forbids to receive a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger without having the Pacifick Letters, which that of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> accords to the Poor and Indigent. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> expreſſes himſelf thereupon in a manner which ſufficiently ſhews they were Letters of Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63628:87"/>as the Interpreter has tranſlated it. In ſhort, in his 3d Oration, which is the 1ſt againſt <hi>Julian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, he ſaith, That amongſt many things which that Cowardly Fugitive from the Truth endeavour'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the uſe and practiſe of amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in imitation of Chriſtians,
<note place="margin">Tom. 1. p. 102.</note> he deſir'd above all things, <hi>To eſtabliſh the uſe of thoſe Letters of Recommendation, by the which,</hi> ſaith this Ancient Doctor, <hi>we ſend from one Country to another, thoſe which are poor and in neceſſity: Zozomen</hi> in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, writes the ſame thing of this Emperor, and ſaith, That by virtue of theſe Letters by which Chriſtians recommended the Strangers of their Communion, they were lodged, and care was taken of them where ever they went, and in what Country ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came, as much as if they had been Friends, and a long while known and acquainted; and that all this was done on account of the Character the Letters gave of them, and which were as 'twere the Mark and Symbol of their Profeſſion; and as I conceive, 'tis what <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the <hi>Conteſſeration of Hoſpitality;</hi> that is to ſay, the mark and ſign, at the ſight whereof, the right of hoſpitality was us'd towards thoſe which ſhew'd it; and 'tis probable <hi>Lucian</hi> had a regard to this Cuſtom, when ſpeaking of a Stranger,
<note place="margin">Dial. de Pereg.</note> he ſaith, that in Travelling, he found plentiful aſſiſtance amongſt the Chriſtians, whereby he was abundantly ſupplied with all things.</p>
                     <p>There is yet ſomething farther to be conſidered in this matter, to wit, That Chriſtians were ſo circumſpect in granting theſe Letters of Recommendation, that they examin'd thoſe which had them, and oblig'd them to give an account of their Faith, to avoid all fraud and ſurpriſe.
<note place="margin">Ubi ſupra.</note> The 58th Canon of the Council of <hi>Eliberi,</hi> or <hi>Eluira</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in the year 305. orders it ſo; the 33d
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63628:87"/>of the Apoſtles is no leſs expreſs, without inſiſting on the Interpretations of <hi>Balſamon, Zonoras,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtenus, Greek</hi> Canoniſts, which have underſtood it in this ſenſe. I can't tell but <hi>Lucian</hi> does again allude to this practiſe of Chriſtians, when he ſaid, That they receive certain <hi>Dogma's</hi> which he mentions, without exactly ſearching the Truth; but I know very well, that we, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, do the ſame as the Primitive Chriſtians did, not only through Cuſtom, but alſo by Order of our National Synods. That of <hi>Charanton,</hi> the Eſtabliſhment whereof is cited in the Article we Examine, That of <hi>Charanton,</hi> I ſay, in the year 1623. enjoins; <hi>Exactly to Examine, as well the Atteſtations, as thoſe which have them, to have from their own mouth, teſtimony of their Religion, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>

                     <p>From the very firſt Eſtabliſhing of Chriſtian Churches, there was in each of them a certain number of Perſons to whom the Government of it was committed, and who were diſtinguiſh'd from the reſt of the People by the Offices which they Exercis'd, and by the choice which had been made of them for ſuperviſing the whole Flock, and 'tis what we call Conſiſtory; <hi>Origen</hi> calls it the Eccleſiaſtical Senate, and makes it parallel with the Politick Senate of each City, to ſhew that the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Senate very much ſurpaſſes the other, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of Perſons of more virtue and knowledg, than thoſe which are Members of Politick Senates in Cities. The Eccleſiaſtical Senate, or Conſiſtory, is compos'd amongſt us of Miniſters and Elders, and it ought not to be thought ſtrange that we joyn Elders with the Miniſters, after all we have ſaid on the 3d Chapter, particularly on the 1ſt Article, where we have at large prov'd, that the Elders have had ſhare for ſeveral Centuries in the Government of the Churches, and that they in all likelihood would have
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63628:88"/>ſtill continued, if the ambition of Biſhops and their Clergy had not inſenſibly aboliſh'd this laudable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.

The Primitive Chriſtians did juſt as we do, they informed Sinners of their Duty, they cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably repreſented to them their faults, they applied to them fit cenſures, they depriv'd them of participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Divine Myſteries, they cauſed them to paſs by certain degrees of Penance proportion'd to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their faults; and when the crimes were heinous, and the obſtinacy ſtout and reſolute, they Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated them, in ſeparating them from the Society of the faithful, as perſons who had made themſelves unworthy of living within the pale of the Church. <hi>Tertullian</hi> has in few words compris'd all this proceeding which I have now touched, when deſcribing the Aſſemblies of his times,
<note place="margin">Apolog. cap. 39.</note> he obſerves, <hi>That therein was made Exhortations, Reprehenſions, and Cenſures; that therein were inflicted pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; that after having maturely weighed all things, Judgment was given, being perſwaded God ſee them; and it is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a great reſemblance of the laſt Judgment, if any one for his ſins is deprived of the Communion of Prayer, from the Aſſembly, and from all holy intercourſe.</hi>

                     <p>Which will alſo appear yet more clearly, if one conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and Martyr of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> has expreſſed the vertue and efficacy of the Communion,

                                 <hi>Brethren, ſee here the fourth time that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you, that</hi> N. <hi>for having committed ſeveral Crimes, and for having ſcandalized the Church of God, and for ſhewing himſelf impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and a contemner of all admonitions which have beén made unto him by the Word of God, has been ſuſpended from the Holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord; the which ſuſpenſion, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it, has been ſignified to you, to the end you may join your Prayers with ours, that it might pleaſe God to ſoften the hardneſs of his heart, and give him true Repentance, drawing him from the way of perdition. But having ſo long time waited for him, prayed and exhorted, and conjur'd him to be converted to God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured all means to bring him to repentance, nevertheleſs perſeveres in his impenitence, and with an incor rigible obſtinacy, rebels againſt God, and tramples under foot his Holy Word, and the Order he has eſtabliſhed in his Church; and glorying in his ſins, is cauſe that the Church for ſo long time, is diſturbed, and the Name of God blaſphemed. We Miniſters of the Goſpel of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whom God has armed with Spiritual weapons, powerful through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds which hold out in oppoſition againſt him, to whom the Eternal Son of God has given power to bind and looſe on Earth, declaring that whatſoever we bind on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven, to the end to purifie the Houſe of God, and free his
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63628:96"/>Church from Scandals, and in pronouncing</hi> Anathema <hi>againſt the wicked, ſhould glorifie the Name of God. In the Name and Authority of the Lord Ieſus, by the advice and authority of the Paſtors and Elders aſſembled in Colloque, and of the Conſiſtory of this Church, we have Retrenched and do Retrench the ſaid</hi> N. <hi>from the Communion of the Church: we Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and remove him from the Society of the Faithful, that he might be to you as a heathen and unbeliever, and amongſt true Chriſtians he may be</hi> Anathema, <hi>and Execrated, let his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany be eſteemed contagious, and let his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fill your ſouls with fear, and make you trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under the mighty hand of God, ſeeing 'tis a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Which Sentence of Excommunication the Son of God will ratifie, and make it effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, until that the ſinner aſhamed and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the ſight of God, gives him glory by his eonverſion, and being freed from theſe chains of Satan, where with he is bound, he bewails his ſins with tears of Repentance. Beloved Brethren, pray unto God that he will have pity on this poor ſinner, and that this fearful Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the which with great ſorrow and ſadneſs of heart we pronounce againſt him in the Name and Authority of the Son of God, may ſerve to humble and turn into the way of truth, a ſoul which is ſtrayed from it.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <p>Chriſtians were not the firſt which inflicted the pain of Excommunication on Rebellious and Scandalous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; Pagans and Jews have practiſed the ſame thing; I ſay Pagans; <hi>Caſar</hi> informs us in his Commentaries, that the <hi>Druids</hi> in <hi>Gaul</hi> Excommunicated thoſe which deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Decrees and their Conſtitutions;
<note place="margin">Lib. 6. pag. 134, 135.</note> forbidding them to approach near the Sacrifices, after which they were lookt upon as impious and obſtinate, every one flying from their company and converſation, fearing to receive ſome harm by infection; and this puniſhment, which was the greateſt of all thoſe they did inflict, put into ſuch a condition thoſe which were ſubjected to it, that they were refuſed the benefit of the Law, altho they earneſtly deſired it; and it alſo deprived them from all degree of honour.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Jews,</hi> every body knows Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was in uſe amongſt them; who, as 'tis ſaid, had three ſorts; the firſt and ſlighteſt, which they called <hi>Niddui,</hi> this ſeparated the guilty from thoſe which were not ſo, but for a little ſpace, and for thirty days only; the ſecond which they called <hi>Herem,</hi> was attended with <hi>Anathema's</hi> and Maledictions, and it was not permitted to eat nor drink with him that was ſo Excommunicated; and 'tis probable St. <hi>Paul</hi> had regard to this kind of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, when he ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. <hi>I write unto you, that you ſhould not eat with ſuch a one.</hi> The third kind of Excommunication was <hi>Shammatta,</hi> by which was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated for ever from the Communion and Society of the Church, him that was guilty.</p>
                     <p>Seeing then that <hi>Jews</hi> and Pagans have exerciſed this power, methinks it would be injuſtice to refuſe it to the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:63628:97"/>Chriſtian Church, ſeeing alſo Jeſus Chriſt her Head and Spouſe has commanded us in his Goſpel to look on him that refuſes to hear the Church, as a Pagan and Heathen; that is to ſay,
<note place="margin">Matt. 18.17.</note> he will, <hi>that he be caſt out of the Church;</hi> or that he be Excommunicated, which amounts all to one thing. St. <hi>Paul</hi> has expreſſed this action by delivering over to Satan, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. unleſs one will ſay that there was ſomething more in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication than in that deſigned by Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>However it be, the Governours of Churches ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the command of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his Apoſtles, have always Exerciſed this Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical power againſt enormous and ſcandalous ſins. <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> have ſhewn on the fifteenth Article, That it was the practiſe of their times; which is alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the places I have cited out of the ſame <hi>Origen</hi> on the precedent Article; and by another of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s, who writes in his Book of Pudicity, <hi>Chap</hi> 4. that theſe ſinners ſhould be driven away from the Incloſure of the Church, and the place of the Aſſembly; and this was the great and true Excommunication whereas the other was only a privation from the Sacraments. To theſe two Witneſſes we may joyn St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Contemporary with <hi>Origen,</hi> who very often in his Epiſtles makes mention of this Cenſure,
<note place="margin">Ep. 28.38, 55, 62 of the laſt Edit.</note> when he ſpeaks, <hi>of removing from the Communion, of not Communicating with ſome one, to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and to caſt out of the Church, to condemn by the mouth of the Paſtor, to kill with the Spiritual Sword.</hi> And other Expreſſions he uſes to declare the ſame thing. The tenth of the Canons attributed to the Apoſtles, does not ſuffer us to be ignorant of this ancient Diſcipline. <hi>Seeing he Excommunicates him that prays with an Excommunicated perſon, in the Houſe only:</hi> I'le inlarge no farther, ſeeing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63628:97"/>one muſt make a Volume, if one would collect all the Canons and Teſtimonies of the Fathers which treat of Excommunication; and more alſo, ſhould one treat of the Hiſtory of Interdiction, which Popes, to render their Power more formidable, have ſent abroad in theſe laſt Ages, contrary to the uſe and practiſe of the Primitive Church, to which they were utterly unknown.</p>
                     <p>As for the Order which is to be followed, according to our Diſcipline, before debarring a ſinner from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, beſides that it is grounded on the Laws and Precepts of Charity, it is alſo conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the practiſe of the Primitive Chriſtians,
<note place="margin">Hom. in Joſ. Tom. 1. p. 185.</note> who by <hi>Origen</hi>'s report, reproved and warned the guilty three ſeveral times before they came to this laſt Extremity. Thence it is alſo, the ſame method was obſerved when there was any mention of depoſing an Eccleſiaſtical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe in ſundry occaſions the ſame faults which deſerved Depoſition of a Church-man, was puniſhed with Excommunication in a Secular, as appears by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Canons, particularly by the ſixth and ſeventh of the firſt Oecumenical Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where we find theſe words, <hi>If they are Biſhops,
<note place="margin">See the Can. 8, &amp; 17. of the Counc. of <hi>Calced.</hi>
                           </note> or others of the Clergy which are depoſed, the Biſhops from Epiſcopacy, the others from the degree they-held in the Clergy, from whence they are quite excluded; but if they are Lay perſons, let them be Excommunicated.</hi> And we have made appear on the 49th. <hi>Artic.</hi> of <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. that a Biſhop was cited three times, or any other Eccleſiaſtical perſon, before proceeding to his depoſing.</p>
                     <p>I don't inſiſt on the form of Excommunication repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after the Article on which I have made the neceſſary remarks, becauſe 'tis in the liberty of the Church in ſuch like occaſions to make uſe of what terms it ſhall judge moſt fitting, provided that in the main it don't depart
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63628:98"/>from the bounds which the Goſpel does preſcribe, nor from the Example of the Holy Apoſtles. Neither do we ſee that in the Primitive Church they were confined to the uſe of a ſorm of words when any one was Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; thoſe which condemned Sinners to that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, having been always Maſters of the form and manner of Excommunication, which is always the ſame in ſubſtance, what variety ſoever there may be in the form wherein it is conceived.</p>

                     <p>Chriſtians have ever eſteemed Synods ſo neceſſary, that they have been very careful to aſſemble them when the good of the Church required it; for as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith in the 51 chap. of the Book of the Life of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Great Controverſies cannot be determin'd but by Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods:</hi> At the beginning, and even during the heat of Perſecution, when there arrived any trouble in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, all the others concern'd themſelves in it, and the Miniſters by a meer movement of Charity, and without any form of Convocation, aſſembled of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to make Peace, and to compoſe Differences: And in theſe Aſſemblies Humane Paſſions being bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and Jeſus Chriſt there preſiding by his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they conſulted together, and reſolv'd without Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Formalities, what was expedient. It is much after this Method they proceeded againſt <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Samoſatia</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> when he had publiſhed his Impiety,
<note place="margin">Euſeb. Hiſt. lib. 7. c. 27, 28, 29.</note> the Paſtors of Churches as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, being run thither from all parts, as againſt an Enemy, which deſtroy'd the Flock of Chriſt. And I can't tell if the Synod of <hi>Iconia</hi> in <hi>Phrygia</hi> mentioned by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſaria</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> was not of the ſame kind of thoſe held againſt <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Samoſatia</hi> in the ſame Century;

                     <p>But what Biſhops did at firſt by a principle of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they were in time obliged to do alſo by Duty, the Cannons requiring it of them: In effect the V. Cannon of the Firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> appoints to hold Synods
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63628:110"/>twice a year in each Province. The Twentieth of the Council of <hi>Antioch</hi> renews the ſame Decree, and thence it is undoubtedly that him which forged the Cannons of the Apoſtles, borrowed the 37, which contains the ſame Eſtabliſhment. The Nineteenth of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving complained that in the Provinces was not celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Synods preſcribed by the Cannons, it appoints they be held twice a year, conformable to the Decrees of the Holy Fathers. There's a number of other Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons which preſcribe the ſame thing, and which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to alleage, to obſerve two things which concern the matter which we examine; the firſt, that <hi>Auitus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> which flouriſhed about the end of the V. Century, and at the beginning of the VI, endeavour'd to reſtore the Antient Cuſtom which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly was left off, as he doth teſtifie in his 80 Letter. It may be thought that the Synod of <hi>Ries</hi> in <hi>Province</hi> had given ſome ſlight endeavour to the firſt practice,
<note place="margin">Tom conc. Gal. <hi>p.</hi> 69. Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 74.</note> in the year 439, when it confirms it in the Eighth Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, but under condition, that times were quiet: That of <hi>Orange</hi> explains it ſelf fuller in the year 441, Cannon 29, ſaying, it was difficult to aſſemble twice a year, by reaſon of ſad and difficult times. The Second thing I mean to obſerve is,
<note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 173. Ib. <hi>p.</hi> 268, 284.</note> That the Synod of <hi>Agde</hi> in <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock</hi> made a Decree in the 71 Cannon, by which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces theſe Synodal Aſſemblies to hold once a year, and it declares in the ſame Cannon, which is of the year 506, that it does ſo according to the conſtitution of the Fathers; having reſpect it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:63628:111"/>Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and to all the Churches to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them of the depoſing of this Arch Heretick; not that 'tis neceſſary to think that the intire Churches aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted at this Council which was aſſembled from ſundry Provinces, but they aſſiſted by ſome of their Body which repreſented them, that is, by ſome of the Body of the People. But to ſay ſomething more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I have ſhewn on the Firſt Article of the Third chap. by Authority of <hi>Fermillian,</hi> and of the <hi>African</hi> Code, that the Elders, ſuch as ours, were deputed to Synods with the Paſtors, againſt whom they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pleaded the right of the People which deputed them.</p>
                     <p>The Second thing I obſerve on this Article is, that the Deputies to Synods are obliged to be preſent there, or to excuſe themſelves by Letter; And if their Excuſe be not ſufficient, they are ſenſur'd as ſhall be thought fit in the Colloques, and in the Provincial Synods, which have power to judge definitively of their Excuſes, and to diſpoſe of their Perſons, which alſo is according to the practice of the Primitive Chriſtians, the Fortieth Cannon of the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is conceiv'd in theſe terms, <hi>The Biſhops which are called to a Synod muſt not neglect to go thither, and if any one does neglect, he will condemn himſelf, unleſs ſome Sickneſs doth hinder him:</hi> The 19th of <hi>Calcedon</hi> requires that one ſhould reprove in a brotherly way thoſe which fail of coming, although they are in good health, and that they are hindred by any extraordinary buſineſs which might not be deferr'd. In <hi>France</hi> no other Excuſe will be admitted, but that of Sickneſs, as appears by a great many Cannons, and amongſt others by that of the Firſt of <hi>Epaume,</hi> by the 1 of the 2 of <hi>Orleans,</hi> by the 80 Letter of <hi>Auitus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and by ſeveral other Decrees which I forbear
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63628:112"/>to cite. The Council of <hi>Agde</hi> in the 35 Cannon joyns to Sickneſs, ſome command of the King, next to which, it deprives from the Communion of the Church till the next Synod, thoſe which have failed to be preſent at the former, and as it deprives them for that time from the Communion of the Church, it alſo deprives them from the Charity of their Brethren, that is, from the other Biſhops, to which the Council of <hi>Tarragona</hi> in the year 517, reduces in the VI. Cannon all the puniſhment of thoſe Biſhops which neglect to be preſent at the Synods where they have been called by the Metropolitans, and excuſes none but them which are hindred by Sickneſs. The 15 of the 11 of <hi>Toledo</hi> aſſembled <hi>Anno</hi> 575, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates them for one year, if they are not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by ſome Sickneſs, or by ſome inevitable neceſſity, the 76 of the <hi>African</hi> Code wills, That they ſhould be content with the Communion of their Church, the V. Cannon of the Council of <hi>Merrida,</hi> of which I will ſpeak on the 10 Article of the IX. chap. excuſes thoſe who are hindred by Sickneſs, or by Order of the Prince.</p>
                     <p>As to what our Diſcipline ſaith, That if the Paſtor comes alone, no heed ſhall be taken of the Memorials he ſhall bring, nor of thoſe the Elder brings if he comes without the Miniſter, it agrees not ill with what we read in the 100 Cannon of the <hi>African</hi> Code, where a Biſhop complains of his Church, but becauſe the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Church had deputed, to defend its cauſe againſt the Biſhop, did not appear, the Council referr'd the Judgment of this Affair to a certain Number of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, whereof ſome were nominated by the Biſhop which was diſſatisfied with his Flock, and the reſt were left to be named by the Elders, although abſent. As for the Memorials whereof mention is made in this Article, more may be ſeen of it in what I ſhall ſay on the Third Article of the Ninth Chapter.</p>

                     <p>There are two things to be conſider'd in this Article, Firſt, That Deputies are not ſuffer'd to depart from the Synod without leave; The Second Council of <hi>Arles</hi> made this Decree in its 19 Cannon, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 452, <hi>If any one thinks he may abandon the Aſſembly of his Brethren before the diſſolution of the Council,
<note place="margin">Tom. 1. Conc. Gall. p. 105.</note> let him know that he is deprived of the Communion of his Brethren, and that he cannot be thereunto received, until he be firſt of all abſolv'd in the following Synod:</hi> There may be ſeen in the Fourth Tome of Councils, certain Fragments attributed to a Council of <hi>Sevil</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> aſſembled about the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the I. in the X. of which is to be found word for word the Decree of the Synod of <hi>Arles;</hi> which makes me believe, that <hi>Burchardus,</hi>

The Fourth Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> aſſembled in the year 633, does defend alſo in the Fourth Cannon, to depart from the Council until all things are decided by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Votes, and Signed by all the Biſhops;
<note place="margin">Tom. 4. Conc. p. 583.</note> The Sixteenth of that of <hi>Worms</hi> of the year 868, preſcribes the ſame thing. <hi>To.</hi> 6. <hi>Conc. pag.</hi> 695.</p>

                     <p>The Second thing our Diſcipline preſcribes thoſe which are Deputies to Synods, is to carry along with them the Deciſions which ſhall be made; I find the ſame thing practic'd in the Antient Church; in Effect, it may be ſeen by the 29th Cannon of the Firſt Council of <hi>Orange</hi> in the year 451, that each Biſhop carried away with him a Copy of the Acts and Reſolutions made in the Aſſembly, and that the like was ſent even to thoſe as were abſent, to advertiſe them of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the Miniſtry of the Metropolitan; and in the year 431, the Firſt Oecumenical Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted each Metropolitan to take a Copy of the Acts, whereof his Brother Biſhops might have Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his means. The Eighth Cannon where this power is granted to Metropolitans, ſaying expreſly that it is for their own ſurety, that is to ſay, for Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rights of their Provinces, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the Rights of all the Suffragan Biſhops.

<note place="margin">Tom. 5.

Pope <hi>Syricius</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Himerius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tarragona,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tom. 1. conc. c. 2. pag. 689.</note> writes towards the end of the 4th. Century, that he thinks convenient young Infants ſhould ſpeedily be Baptis'd.

                        <note place="margin">Tom. 2. pag. 360, 361.</note> is of the ſame Mind, and even attributes it to the Apoſtles, although he determines not exactly the time. I ſhould never have done ſhould I produce all the Teſtimonies of the Antients touching the Baptiſing young Children, ſeeing it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been practis'd in the Church; my deſign is chiefly
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:63628:139"/>to ſhew that the Authors of our Diſcipline had reaſon when they appointed not to defer Baptiſing of young Children too long; and I have ſufficiently ſhewed that this practiſe is conformable to that of the Antient Church.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs it is not to be thought this practiſe has always been ſo well eſtabliſh'd in the Church, that it has not found ſome Oppoſers, <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter of his Treatiſe of Baptiſm, would have their Baptiſm put off till they were of Age to give an account of their Faith. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> don't go quite ſo far,
<note place="margin">Orat. 40. p. 658.

The Chriſtians of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> referred the Chriſtening of their Children till <hi>Eaſter</hi> whatever accident befell them, ſo that a great many of them dyed without Baptiſm, as <hi>Socrates</hi> obſerves in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, Chap. 12. Book 5. The more I conſider all theſe things, the more I approve the Conduct of our Diſcipline, which prudently enjoyns Conſiſtories to take care that the Baptiſing of Infants ſhould not be deferr'd too long.</p>
                     <p>As for Adults, it is well known that in the Primitive Church, many deferr'd their Baptiſm a long while, and many times to the end of their Life; but it is alſo known that the Fathers have condemned thoſe which did after this Manner.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt. The Miniſter ſhall ſay,</hi> Our Lord ſhews us all in what poverty and miſery we were born, in telling us we muſt be regenerated, for if it be needful our Nature be renewed to have admiſſion into the Kingdom of Heaven, it is a ſign 'tis wholly ſinful and curſed; therein therefore he warns us to be humbled, and caſt down in our-ſelves, and in this manner he prepares us to deſire and ſeek his favour,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:63628:144"/>whereby all the perverſeneſs and evil of our firſt Nature ſhall be aboliſhed; for we are not capable of receiving it, until firſt we have wholly laid aſide all truſt in our own Strength, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, even to condemning all that is in us.</p>
                  <p>Now when he has ſhewn us our miſery, he then comforts us by his mercy, promiſing to regenerate us by his Holy Spirit to a Holy Life, which ſhall be to us as the entrance into his Kingdom; This Regeneration conſiſts in two parts, which is that we ſhould deny our ſelves, not following the way of our own reaſon, our Pleaſure, and own Will, but ſubjecting our underſtanding and heart to the Wiſdom and Will of God, mortifying all that is of us, and of the Fleſh, afterwards we ſhould follow the light of God, to comply and ſubmit to his Holy Will, as he commands us by his Word, and bads us by his Spirit. The accompliſhment both of the one and the other is in our Lord Jeſus, whoſe Death and Paſſion is of ſuch Vertue, that partaking thereof, we are as it were Dead to Sin, to the end that our fleſhly Luſts ſhould be mortified. In like manner by vertue of his Reſurrection, we may be raiſed to a new Life, which is God, being Govern'd and Conducted by his Holy Spirit which worketh in us things well pleaſing in his ſight. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the firſt and principal point of our Salvation, is that by his Mercy he pardon and forgives us all our ſins not imputing them to us, but blotting them out that they ſhould not riſe up in Judgment againſt us. All theſe Graces are beſtow'd on us when he is pleaſed to ingraff us into his Church by Baptiſme; for in this Sacrament he aſſures us of the pardon of our ſins; And to this end he hath appointed the Sign of Water, to ſhew us, That as by this Element Bodily filthineſs is waſhed away, he will alſo waſh and purifie our Souls, that there might be no ſpot in them. Then he ſhews us our Renovation, the which lyes, as has been ſaid, in the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:63628:144"/>Mortification of our Fleſh, and in a Spiritual Life which he worketh in us.</p>
                  <p>So ſhall we receive double Grace and benefit of our God in Baptiſme, provided we do not fruſtrate the vertue of this Sacrament by our ingratitude, which is that we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in certain aſſurance that God will be a merciful Father to us, not imputing our Sins and Offences.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he will aſſiſt us by his Holy Spirit, to the end we may reſiſt the Devil, Sin, and the Luſts of the Fleſh, even till we triumph over them, to live in the liberty of his Kingdom, which is the Kingdom of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then 'tis ſo that theſe two things are accompliſh'd in us by the love of Jeſus Chriſt, it follows that the vertue and ſubſtance of Baptiſme is compris'd in him, and indeed we have no other cleanſing but his Blood, nor no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing but in his Death and Reſurrection, but as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to us his Riches, and Bleſſings by his Word, ſo alſo he diſtributes them to us by his Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>Now herein appears the wonderful Love of God towards us, that thoſe Graces he beſtows upon us, having before the coming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> been reſtrain'd within the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the partition Wall which ſeparated the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> being taken away by the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, he ſhed abroad the Waters of his Saving Grace in ſuch abundant manner, on the Children of Men, that in him there is now neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Greek,</hi> Male nor Female, Circumciſion nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, nor any other Creature elſe, which can hinder us from this great Salvation, that Jeſus Chriſt will be preached to all Nations, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his Love confirm'd by Baptiſme, according to the Commiſſion given to his Apoſtles, ſaying, <hi>Go Preach to all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> And it is

                     <p>In the book of Sacraments of <hi>Gregory</hi> I.
<note place="margin">Pag. 73.</note> it is demanded of the Party to be baptiſed, <hi>Do you believe in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth?</hi> He anſwers, I do believe. <hi>Do you believe in Jeſus Chriſt his only Son our Lord, which was born, and ſuffered?</hi> I do believe. <hi>Do you alſo believe in the Holy Ghoſt? do you believe the holy Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveneſs of Sins, the Reſurrection of the Body, and the Life Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting?</hi> I do believe. <hi>Do you deſire to be Baptiſed?</hi> I do. Somthing to this purpoſe is to be read in the book of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, whereof I made mention in the foregoing Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the place I noted. Beſides, there's great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that St. <hi>Peter</hi> made Alluſion to this practice
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63628:151"/>when he ſaid in the 3d. Chap. of his firſt Epiſtle, that the Baptiſm whereby we are ſaved, is not that whereby the filthineſs of the Fleſh is waſhed, <hi>but the witneſs of a good Conſcience in the ſight of God the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> Word which we have tranſlated Witneſs, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies properly <hi>Interrogation.</hi> I add for a Concluſion of theſe matters, that thoſe which were to be baptiſed were bound to recite the Symbol of their Faith, to renounce the Devil, to his Power, and his Angels; to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they were by Nature Children of Wrath, and to ſhew Repentance and Sorrow for their Sins committed during the time of their Ignorance, and if they were inſtructed in the knowledge of Heavenly things, they were alſo taught to live well, that is to ſay, holily, and in a way anſwerable to their Vocation. The Nature and Fruits of Baptiſm was explain'd to them. They had alſo ſome Light of the Euchariſt ſhewed them, becauſe they did communicate preſently after being baptiſed, and all theſe things were accompanied with Ardent Prayers to God as well to render him thanks for calling them to his bleſſed Communion, as to implore his Grace and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction on them at the very inſtant that he honour'd them with the ſeal of his Covenant, and Sacrament of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. After all I have ſaid, the perfect reſemblance may eaſily be ſeen which is found in the Matter I Examin, betwixt our practice and that of the Ancient Church, if you except what regards <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> which appearing but in the laſt Century, could be neither the Subject nor Matter of any of the Decrees of the Cannon Law.</p>

Century or at leaſt to the end of the 6th. it was never thought of to propoſe in the works of Eccleſiaſtical Writers, nor in Councils, Spiritual Cognations, as lawful hindrances of wedlock. If the Epiſtle attributed to Pope <hi>Deus-dedit</hi> were true, it would not be deny'd that ſince the 7th. Century, theſe pretended Spiritual Cognations were admitted in the Church, but 'tis moſt certain 'tis falſe and ſpurious, it needs only to Read it to find that 'tis falſe and forged, beſides that a good while ſince,

                     <p>I know there is in the 2d.

Luke D' Achery</hi> who has cauſed them to be printed in the 2 Volumns of his Spicilegium, amongſt an Ancient Collection of Cannons, which he thinks to have
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:63628:161"/>been Antecedent to the 9th.

Article.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> Church would in nothing come behind the <hi>Latin</hi> in this matter; for at the end of the 8th Century,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:63628:162"/>the 6th. Oecumenical Council aſſembled at <hi>Constantinople</hi> made a decree, when after having eſtabliſh'd that the affinity of the Spirit is more conſiderable than that of the Body, the Fathers declare it is come to their knowledge, that in ſome places, thoſe which have preſented Children to be Baptiſed, do after marry the Mothers of thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they are become Widows, which the Council forbids to be done for the future, and do even make null Marriages of this kind, which ſhall be made after the Prohibition' and condemn thoſe which contract them to the puniſhment of Fornicators. We learn by this Decree, that till then no difficulty was made in divers Places to make theſe kinds of marriages, and to paſs by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ſpiritual Cognations which might be betwixt thoſe as made them.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs ſince the 6th. Century, the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian</hi> had ordained that ſpiritual Cognation ſhould be a lawful hinderance of Marriage,
<note place="margin">Lib. 5. Cod. Juſt. tit. 4. cap. 26.</note> although the <hi>Greek</hi> Church made no Decree before that I but now cited and which is after that of <hi>Justiniam</hi> above a 100 years. Alſo the <hi>Greek</hi> Cannoniſts which have ſearched the Original of this cuſtom, have gone no farther then the Cannon of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the law of this Emperour. But what ſurpriſes me is to ſee Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the firſt in his Anſwer to the Interrogatories of the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> in not making theſe Impediments of Marriages proceed from the Decrees of his Predeceſſors, but from the laws of Princes and Sovereigns, as if what the Church has done in this occaſion was only the Execution of the command of Kings and Emperours. I will ſay nothing of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Cannons, attributed to the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the 21th. and 23th. of which treat of ſpiritual Cognations, becauſe by confeſſion of the Learned which have any candor and ſincerity, theſe are forged Cannons,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:63628:162"/>and were forged ſeveral years after the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> It is better I ſhould finiſh the examining of this Article by this remark, that when our Diſcipline declared that theſe cognations, called ſpiritual, hindred not to contract Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, it follow'd the ſteps of the Primitive Chriſtians to whom this ſort of Affinitys and Relations was unknown for the firſt 6 whole Centuries, or little leſs, for towards the end of the 6th. the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian</hi> made a Law, but 'twas not ſoon obſerved in the Church.</p>

I ſhould be over-tedious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all I could alleage for Eſtabliſhing this Truth; I ſhall therefore content my ſelf to prove it by ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and poſitive Teſtimonies which ſhall be above the reach of any contentious Spirits to controul.</p>
                     <p>To do it with the better method, Firſt of all, 'twill be neceſſary to tranſcribe two paſſages of the Goſpel, where our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt has fully explain'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on this matter, The Firſt is in the Fifth chap. of St. <hi>Matth, ver.</hi> 31, 32. It hath been alſo ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife let him give her a Writing of Divorcement: But I ſay unto you, That whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife ſaving for the cauſe of Fornication, cauſeth her to commit Adultery, and whoſoever ſhall marry her that is divorced committeth Adultery.</hi> Theſe words as every one ſees, teach us two things, one, that there's nothing but Adultery which is a lawful cauſe of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Marriage; and the other, that here is to be an intire Separation, both from Bed, and as to Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:63628:172"/>
                     <p>The Second is in the 19th <hi>chap.</hi> of the ſame Goſpel, <hi>verſe</hi> 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> alſo came unto him, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, and ſaying unto him, <hi>Is it lawful for a man to put away his Wife for every cauſe, and he anſwered and ſaid unto them, Have you not read that he which made them, made them at the beginning Male and Female, and ſaid, For this cauſe ſhall a man leave father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſhall cleave to his Wife, and they twain ſhall be one fleſh, wherefore they are no more twain but one fleſh; What therefore God has joyned together, let no man put aſunder. They ſay unto him, Why did</hi> Moſes <hi>then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away: He ſaith unto them,</hi> Moſes <hi>becauſe of the hardneſs of your hearts ſuffer'd you to put away your Wifes, but from the beginning it was not ſo. And I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall put away his wife except it be for fornication, and ſhall marry another, committeth Adultery: And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever marryeth her which is put away, doth commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi> As the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in their demand underſtood a total Separation, it muſt not alſo be doubted but Jeſus Chriſt meant it ſo alſo in the Anſwer he made them; In effect, amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> the term to repudiate compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends an intire rupture, with power to re-marry again; Therefore in the Antient formulary of Divorces amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Husband ſpake thus to the Wife which he put away, <hi>I ſend thee going, and repudiate thee, to the end thou mayeſt be at liberty to marry whom thou wilt.</hi>

<note place="margin">Tom 10. p 633.</note> and of the number of 600 Biſhops there preſent; and apparently it was in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this great number of Prelates,
<note place="margin">Tom. 1. Conc. Gall. p. 105. Tom. 1. Conc. Gall. p. 6.</note> that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Second Council aſſembled in the ſame City in the year 542, ſaid in the Eighteenth Cannon, <hi>That the firſt was aſſembled from all parts of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However it be, the Tenth Cannon of the Firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil which concerns the buſineſs we treat of, is expreſſed in theſe terms: <hi>As to young Men that are Believers, which ſurprize their Wifes in Adultery, and who are forbidden to marry others, It has ſeem'd good to us that they ſhould be advis'd as much as may be; not to marry again during their Wifes life time although Adultereſſes.</hi> I gather two things from this Cannon, Firſt, Before the holding this Council, there were thoſe which prohibited them which left their Wifes for Adultery to marry again. Secondly, That the Fathers of the Council to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 600, amongſt which there are Two Prieſts and Two Deacons of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which held the place of <hi>Silveſter</hi> its Biſhop; theſe Prelates having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely examined the buſineſs, changed the Prohibition into an Advice which they deſired might be followed, but no farther than Mans weakneſs could bear, which ſhews that they did not believe as now a days in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion, That the Band of Marriage is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolvable, though Adultery ſhould intervene.</p>
                     <p>In the year of our Lord 465 there was held a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Vannes</hi> in <hi>Brittany,</hi> ſee here its Second Cannon. <hi>As for thoſe who forſake their Wifes,
<note place="margin">Tom. 1.

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:63628:175"/>Cannon, that when the Adultery was proved, it was permitted to conclude another Marriage; it was ſo 'twas underſtood by Father <hi>Sirmond</hi> on the Letter of <hi>Auitus</hi> above-mentioned, wherein he was followed by his Nephew Mr. <hi>De la Lande</hi> Treaſurer, of the Church of St. <hi>Framburg</hi> of <hi>Senlis;</hi> for in the Supplement of <hi>French</hi> Councils,
<note place="margin">pag. 349.</note> he explains this Cannon in the ſame manner as I have explained it, and this ought not to be regarded as a private interpretation, ſeeing this Supplement was approved by the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> aſſembled at <hi>Paris</hi> in the years 1655, and 56.</p>
                     <p>The Synod of <hi>Agde</hi> in <hi>Languedoc</hi> in the year 506,
<note place="margin">Tom. 1. Conc.

Century, and the Councils of <hi>Verbery</hi> and <hi>Compeign,</hi> in the 8th. who permitted as has been ſhewn, to the innocent party, to re-marry, when the band of the former Marrirge is quite broke by Adultery; certainly the Fathers of theſe two Councils intended not to forbid Marriage to thoſe which Adultery had ſeparated, ſeeing they allowed ſeparation for things of much leſs moment than is that of Adultery, and that at the ſame time they grant power and liberty to

                     <p>This laſt Cannon of the Synod of <hi>Verbery</hi> in the 5th.
<note place="margin">Ubi ſupra 42, 43, 44</note> of that of <hi>Compeign,</hi> where we Read theſe words; If a free man has taken in Marriage a woman whom he thought to be free, and afterwards he found ſhe was not, let him put her away if he will, and let him Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry another.</p>
                     <p>The 4th. of the ſame Council of <hi>Compeign</hi> makes this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; If a man has marri'd his Wiſes Daughter being
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:63628:182"/>of a free ſtate, to a free man, or to a ſlave, or to a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that he married her againſt her will, and againſt the will of her Mother, and her relations, if ſhe will not have him for a Husband, and that ſhe leave him, her Relations may give her another, or if ſhe herſelf has Married another, after having left the firſt, let them not be ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>In the 13th. we Read this, if any one has left his wife; and in conſideration of Piety and Religion, he has given her liberty to enter into a Monaſtery; or that for the Love of God, he has ſuffer'd her to take the vail out of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery; let this Man take a lawful wife, and let the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man do the ſame on the like occaſion.</p>
                     <p>The 16th. is contained in theſe words, if a Leprous man has a Wife that is clean and ſound, and that he will ſuffer her to marry another, let the woman marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if ſhe pleaſe,
<note place="margin">Ib. can. 2.9.</note> and let the Husband do the ſame. Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> the ſecond preſcribed near hand the ſame thing three years before, from whence may be gathered, that according to all appearance he would have made no difficulty to approve the re-marrying of thoſe whom A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery had ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs I could produce ſeveral other proofs for Eſtabliſhing the matter I Examine, if I feared not to be to tedious, I will therefore end this enquiry by two remarks; the firſt concerns Eccleſiaſtical Writers which teach, that it is lawful to ſeparate for Adultery, as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> who thus explains himſelf;
<note place="margin">Contr. Marc. l. 4. c. 34.</note>

                     <p>In my ſecond Remark I produce the Teſtimonies of two famous Doctors of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which teſtifie Marriage is entirely diſſolved by Adultery, and that the band is quite broke, the firſt is of St.
<note place="margin">Hom. 19. pag. 484, 485.</note> 
                        <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> who in his Homilies on the 7th. chap. of the firſt Epiſtle to the Cor. teaches poſitively, That the Husband which puts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way an Adulterous Wife is not culpable; And if you ask him the Reaſon, he'll tell you it is, The Marriage is already diſſolved, and that after the fornication, the the Husband is no longer a Husband.</p>
                     <p>The other Witneſs is <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who Treating of this buſineſs in his Therapeutique, or manner of healing the affections of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> makes this Reflection,

<note place="margin">Ib. p. 620.</note>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:63628:183"/>then He commands to diſſolve and break the Bands:</hi> Nothing can be deſir'd more poſitive nor more clear for proving the matter I treat of, therefore I conclude, in obſerving, that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Theodoret's</hi> Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do no leſs favour the Article of our Depoſition, than the Teſtimonies I produced at firſt, as well of Eccleſiaſtical Writers, as of Councils, by all which I have made clearly appear, that in the Ancient Church they were perſwaded, as they are at this preſent amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and amongſt the Proteſtants, that Jeſus Chriſt ſuffers Chriſtians to ſeparate from their Wifes for the reaſon of Adultery, and to marry others.</p>

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:63628:185"/>of <hi>Laodicea</hi> after having declared in the 35th Cannon, that Chriſtians ſhould not forſake the Church of God to follow Angels to invoke them it makes this Mennace, <hi>If any one be found to ſerve this hidden Idolatry, let him be anathematiſed, becauſe he has forſaken our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, and is turn'd to Idolatry.</hi>
